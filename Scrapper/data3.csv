Why were so many of them turning to therapy in the first place? Why had these lovely and promising human beings fallen prey to depression, eating disorders, suicide attempts, and crushingly low self-esteem? The answer hit a nerve with Pipher, with parents, and with the girls themselves. Crashing and burning in a &#8220;developmental Bermuda Triangle,&#8221; they were coming of age in a media-saturated culture preoccupied with unrealistic ideals of beauty and images of dehumanized sex, a culture rife with addictions and sexually transmitted diseases. They were losing their resiliency and optimism in a &#8220;girl-poisoning&#8221; culture that propagated values at odds with those necessary to survive.&#160;&#160;&#160;<br><br>Told in the brave, fearless, and honest voices of the girls themselves who are emerging from the chaos of adolescence, <i>Reviving Ophelia</i> is a call to arms, offering important tactics, empathy, and strength, and urging a change where young hearts can flourish again, and rediscover and reengage their sense of self.",Mary  Pipher,Parenting & Relationships,1594481881

Coming up with stimulating game ideas is not always easy, though. Some units have limited space in their meeting halls, or need games for very small or very large numbers of youth. The Scout Games book is designed to help Scoutmasters deliver meeting fun regardless of the challenges any unit may face. This includes: active games; traditional games; indoor games; outdoor games; games suited for youth of varied ages; heights and weights; games for large groups; and games for small groups. There are many options to help solve the diverse problems a leader might face. Even games designed to reinforce Scouting skills like knot tying and first aid are included. Some of these games originated with Baden Powell and are time tested, while other games are more contemporary. They are all Scout tested and guaranteed to deliver fun. Games are rated with between one and five stars. Five-star games are the best and most fun, while one-star games are less fun but are still enjoyable. We hope that you enjoy this collection of scout games and that they help you deliver an outstanding program.",Thomas Mercaldo,Sports & Outdoors,1500673862

11,I Am Rich Potosi: The Mountain That Eats Men,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518SNqOf5hL.jpg,"The magnificent mountain of Potos&iacute; in Bolivia yielded more silver than any other mountain or region of the world. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries this wealth flowed through Spain into Europe and played an important role in the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution and trade with Asia. Yet the grueling work of extracting the silver was left to the indigenous population of the Andes, who were enslaved by the Spanish and died by the thousands on the mountain.<br><br> Today, Potos&iacute; maintains this unique culture, based on its epic history. Approximately eighteen thousand miners still work in or around the mountain, searching for trace amounts of silver and tin. Inside the mountain, miners worship their devil, who is represented as a sexually potent Spaniard, lord of the mineral realm. Photographer Stephen Ferry has made many trips to Potos&iacute; to document this ongoing drama. His color images describe this world, which echoes back to the birth of modern Europe yet is one of the poorest places in the Americas.<br><br> The text by Eduardo Galeano illuminates the complexity of the intersection of ancient rituals and the grandeur of the mountain and complements Ferry's powerful portrait of this fascinating area. Ferry's photographs are divided into four sections: the miners' carnival; work that still takes place in and around the rich mountain; major institutions of civic life in the city of Potos&iacute;; and the festival of Esprit?, in which miners sacrifice llamas to the devil within the mountain to appease his thirst for blood so that he will not take their lives with accidents or illness.",Stephen Ferry,Travel,158093028X
12,The Four Wars of 1812,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O0jrhXiiL.jpg,"<DIV>June 2012 marks the two hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the War of 1812. Most people know the War of 1812 as the military conflict between Great Britain and the United States that lasted from 1812 until 1815, but the truth is that Canada, including Canadian First Peoples, and Native Americans were caught up in the war too. This highly visual book with photographs and maps supplied by the Canadian War Museum and text by distinguished historian Peter MacLeod, examines the War of 1812 from the diverse perspectives of American, British, Canadian, and Native participants. For Canadians, the War of 1812 was all about American invasions. For Americans, it was about standing up to Britain. For the British, it was an annoying sideshow to the Napoleonic Wars raging in Europe. For Native Americans, it was a desperate struggle for freedom and independence as they fought to defend their homelands. Canadians and Americans have used the War of 1812 as a source for nation-building narratives, centred on their stories of the war. But all four groups fought and remembered their own War of 1812. Viewing the conflict through the eyes of the four principal combatants will provide readers with a better appreciation of the War of 1812, a crucial event in Canadian history.<br><BR>The book's publication will coincide with the opening of a major corresponding exhibit at the Canadian War Museum about the War of 1812, which will run from June 15, 2012 to January 6, 2013.",D.

18,Bone Densitometry and Osteoporosis,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Pn1QW-meL.jpg,"The diagnosis of osteoporosis and the determination of fracture risk has always been a challenge for radiologists, epidemiologists, and clinicians as well as oth­ er researchers and health care professionals working in the field. It is bone min­ eral density that is closely related to bone fragility, and the advent of techniques to quantitatively assess bone density has been welcomed. It has reduced the sub­ jectivity inherent to conventional radiologic assessment of osteoporosis. The on­ going technical process has made various techJ)iques to assess bone density wide­ ly available. However, these measurement techniques have also incurred some crit­ icism because bone densitometry has sometimes been applied without specific indications and without appropriate clinical ramifications. The purpose of this text is to provide a perspective on the current status of bone densitometry and ist relevance to osteoporosis diagnosis and management. Therefore, this book will give the reader an introduction to the nature of osteo­ porosis, its pathophysiology and epidemiology, and the clinical consequences of performing bone densitometry. Aside from standard bone densitometry, newer technologies such as quantitative ultrasound techniques, magnetic resonance imaging and bone structure analysis are discussed in the context of diagnosing osteoporosis.",,"Health, Fitness & Dieting",364280442X

This volume gives an overview of the most important results of these research efforts and provides information about the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza with particular emphasis on recent H5N1 outbreaks in China, Siberia and Europe. Several articles deal with new vaccination strategies, the use of antivirals and other control measures to combat outbreaks of avian influenza. Further chapters illustrate that molecular biology, culminating in the generation of influenza viruses by recombinant DNA technology, was instrumental in unravelling the roles of the viral hemagglutinin and polymerase as well as cellular signalling pathways and innate immunity in pathogenesis and interspecies transmission. Finally, the threat of a pandemic originating from avian influenza viruses is illustrated by the example of the Spanish influenza of 1918. This comprehensive publication on avian influenza viruses and their relevance for human influenza will be of great value to all influenza virologists, molecular biologists, public health scientists, veterinary virologists, ecologists, and scientists engaged in drug design and vaccine development.",,Medical Books,3805585012

Everyday life situations ~ break ups, marriages, money trouble, kid trouble, miscommunication, frustration. Overcoming problematic life situations ~ usually with comedy. When a scene isn’t going “right” the director shouts “CUT.” This is what you will be doing when you re-direct your own life. You will be shouting “CUT” and re-directing your reaction, thus changing your experience in this one life to live. To navigate your way through this life, your vehicle is your body. What if you know certain actions which will prevent anxiety, help you walk through it or recover from the after effects? You’d likely feel more in control.

It turns out that many companies around the world are missing a key point: that global leadership is distinctly different from the leadership skills needed in a domestic operation. The global economy requires a new set of leadership skills-imbued with a global mindset, multi-functional and effective across cultures and nationalities-that were not as critical even a decade ago. <BR><BR>In <i>What Is Global Leadership?, </i>the authors draw on cutting-edge research conducted by Aperian Global, including first-hand interviews with successful global leaders, which highlights ten key behaviors critical to international settings, such as cultural self-awareness, frame-shifting, and developing ""third-way solutions."" <BR><BR>In addition to providing a detailed description of each behavior, the authors demonstrate how these can be applied in the context of leadership development programs, executive coaching, global teams, and leader-led action learning. Whether one is leading an entire organization, a business unit, or a geographically dispersed team, this essential guide provides an important resource for developing global leadership talent.",Ernest Gundling,Business & Money,1904838235

A peerless American storyteller, his oeuvre has been celebrated for decades-from the Martian Chronicles and Fahrenheit 451 to Dandelion Wine and Something Wicked This Way Comes.<br /><br />The Illustrated Man is classic Bradbury-a collection of tales that breathe and move, animated by sharp, intaken breath and flexing muscle. Here are eighteen startling visions as keen as the tattooist's needle and as colorful as the inks that indelibly stain the body.<br /><br />The images, ideas, sounds, and scents that abound in this phantasmagoric sideshow are provocative and powerful: the mournful cries of celestial travelers cast out cruelly into a vast, empty space of stars and blackness; the sight of grey dust settling over a forgotten outpost on a road that leads nowhere; the pungent odor of Jupiter on a returning father's clothing. Here living cities take their vengeance, technology awakens the most primal natural instincts, Martian invasions are foiled by the good life and the glad hand, and dreams are carried aloft in junkyard rockets.<br /><br />Bradbury's The Illustrated Man is a kaleidoscopic blending of magic, imagination, and truth, widely believed to be one of the grandmaster's premier accomplishments: as exhilarating as interplanetary travel, as maddening as a walk in a million-year rain, and as comforting as simple, familiar rituals on the last night of the world.<br /><br />The stories contained in The Illustrated Man are ""Prologue: The Illustrated Man,"" ""The Veldt,"" ""Kaleidoscope,"" ""The Other Foot,"" ""The Highway,"" ""The Man,"" ""The Long Rain,"" ""The Rocket Man,"" ""The Last Night of the World,"" ""The Exiles,"" ""No Particular Night or Morning,"" ""The Fox and the Forest,"" ""The Visitor,"" ""The Concrete Mixer,"" ""Marionettes, Inc. ,"" ""The City,"" ""Zero Hour,"" ""The Rocket,"" and ""The Illustrated Man.""",Ray Bradbury,Science Fiction & Fantasy,1400168260

For the rest of his days he lived out the implications of that transformation&#8212;as exile, inspired reformer, and ultimately the dominant figure of the Protestant Reformation. Calvin&#8217;s vision of the Christian religion has inspired many volumes of analysis, but this engaging biography examines a remarkable life. Bruce Gordon presents Calvin as a human being, a man at once brilliant, arrogant, charismatic, unforgiving, generous, and shrewd. </P><P>The book explores with particular insight Calvin&#8217;s self-conscious view of himself as prophet and apostle for his age and his struggle to tame a sense of his own superiority, perceived by others as arrogance. Gordon looks at Calvin&#8217;s character, his maturing vision of God and humanity, his personal tragedies and failures, his extensive relationships with others, and the context within which he wrote and taught. What emerges is a man who devoted himself to the Church, inspiring and transforming the lives of others, especially those who suffered persecution for their religious beliefs.",F.

35,Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C4Vkw0E2L.jpg,"<p>In the summer of 2015, as he vaulted to the lead among the many GOP candidates for president, Donald Trump was the only one dogged by questions about his true intentions. This most famous American businessman had played the role of provocateur so often that pundits, reporters, and voters struggled to believe that he was a serious contender. Trump stirred so much controversy that his candidacy puzzled anyone who applied ordinary political logic to the race. But as Michael D'Antonio shows in <i>Never Enough</i>, Trump has rarely been ordinary in his pursuit of success and his trademark method is based on a logic that begins with his firm belief that he is a singular and superior human being.</p><p>As revealed in this landmark biography, Donald Trump is a man whose appetite for wealth, attention, power, and conquest is practically insatiable. Declaring that he is still the person he was as a rascally little boy, Trump confesses that he avoids reflecting on himself ""because I might not like what I see"" and he believes ""most people aren't worthy of respect.""</p><p>A product of the media age and the Me Generation that emerged in the 1970s, Trump was a Broadway showman before he became a developer. Mentored by the scoundrel attorney Roy Cohn, Trump was a regular on the New York club scene and won press attention as a dashing young mogul before he had built his first major project. He leveraged his father's enormous fortune and political connections to get his business off the ground, and soon developed a larger-than-life persona. In time, and through many setbacks, he made himself into a living symbol of extravagance and achievement. </p><p>Drawing upon extensive and exclusive interviews with Trump and many of his family members, including all his adult children, D'Antonio presents the full story of a truly American icon, from his beginnings as a businessman to his stormy romantic life and his pursuit of power in its many forms. For all those who wonder: Just who is Donald Trump?,<i> Never Enough</i> supplies the answer. He is a promoter, builder, performer and politician who pursues success with a drive that borders on obsession and yet, has given him, almost everything he ever wanted.</p>",Michael D'Antonio,Business & Money,1250042380

69,Islam Dismantled: The Mental Illness of Prophet Muhammad,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fcsMz7QZL.jpg,"This book dismantles Islam by exposing the imposture of Muhammad. The historical Muhammad is too privileged to be formally evaluated in the fashion a clinical psychologist would like. But given certain of his well-known and highly documented behaviors, it is certain that he had a conflict-ridden psychological dependence on others. He was not capable of introspection. He had shown all the symptoms of his lunacy and his prophetic claim was based on the quicksand of grand delusion. But the irony is that the entire religion of Islam is based on the truth claim of such a man who could easily swing back and forth between the two extremes - reality and fantasy. Like the mythological Narcissus, he actually worshipped his own image - not God. He had created Allah in his own image and attributed to that God the qualities of his own self. He used Islam to pervade Muslim psyche, and possessed their mind. Islam is an extremely defenseless religion and hence vulnerable to collapse. ""Defenseless"" in the sense, there is not a single atom of truth in it to support. This failed religion, originated from the grand delusion of a malignant Narcissist, is the biggest hoax humanity has ever seen. It is like a house of cards - looks tall, big, mighty and gigantic but the base is very weak. The aim of this book is to diagnose Muhammad by making use of biographical data and through the application of psychological theory and research. This psychobiography is all about the ""why"" - the question of motives. It uncovers the private motives behind his public acts. This book presents two theses - Muhammad suffered from malignant narcissism, and was also affected by neurotic disorder which caused regular psychiatric delusions.",Sujit Das,Religion & Spirituality,1926800060

Forbidden soulmates. When I arrived to Edgewood, Wisconsin I didn’t plan to find him. I didn't plan to stumble into Joe's bar and have Daniel's music stir up my emotions. I had no clue that his voice would make my hurts forget their own sorrow. I had no idea that my happiness would remember its own bliss. When I started senior year at my new school, I wasn’t prepared to call him Mr. Daniels, but sometimes life happens at the wrong time for all the right reasons. Our love story wasn’t only about the physical connection. It was about family. It was about loss. It was about being alive. It was silly. It was painful. It was mourning. It was laughter. It was ours. And for those reasons alone, I would never apologize for loving Mr. Daniels. -Ashlyn Jennings",Brittainy C. Cherry,Romance,1499516959

85,Quantum Theory & Applications of Chemical Reaction Dynamics,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sV%2Bpm1GPL.jpg,"<p>This book provides a detailed presentation of modern quantum theories for treating the reaction dynamics of small molecular systems. Its main focus is on the recent development of successful quantum dynamics theories and computational methods for studying the molecular reactive scattering process, with specific applications given in detail for a number of benchmark chemical reaction systems in the gas phase and the gas surface. In contrast to traditional books on collision in physics focusing on abstract theory for nonreactive scattering, this book deals with both the development and the application of the modern reactive or rearrangement scattering theory, and is written in a fashion in which the development of the reactive scattering theory is closely coupled with its computational aspects for practical applications for realistic molecular reactions. The volume includes such topics as methods for calculating rovibrational states of molecules, fundamental quantum theory for scattering (nonreactive and reactive), modern time-independent computational methods for reactive scattering, general time-dependent wave packet methods for reactive scattering, dynamics theory of chemical reactions, dynamics of molecular fragmentation, semiclassical description of quantum mechanics, and also some useful appendices.</p> <p>The book is intended for the reader to not only understand the molecular reaction dynamics from the fundamental scattering theory, but also utilize the provided computational methodologies in their practical applications. It should benefit graduate students and researchers in the field of chemical physics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",John Zh Zhang,Science & Math,9810233884

In Davidson's own words, <q>the people in the subway, their flesh juxtaposed against the graffiti, the penetrating effect of the strobe light itself, and even the hollow darkness of the tunnels, inspired an aesthetic that goes unnoticed by passengers who are trapped underground, hiding behind masks and closed off from each other.</q> In this third edition of what is now a classic of photographic literature, a sequence of 118 (including 25 previously unpublished) images transport the viewer through a landscape at times menacing, and at other times lyrical and soulful. The images present the full gamut of New Yorkers, from weary straphangers and languorous ladies in summer dresses to stalking predators and homeless persons.

While it confirms some of the West’s criticisms, it offers a unique alternative viewpoint and questions a number of long-held and seldom challenged beliefs, including the almost universal cliché that at Independence Zimbabwe had everything going for it and threw it all away through bad government. It offers a fresh assessment of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s military involvement in the Congo, the Gukurahundi massacres in Matebeleland, sanctions, human rights, the rule of law, the media and culture in Zimbabwe and builds on recent research which demonstrates that the reality of the Land Reform and other aspects of the country’s recent history belie the unquestioned and widely-propagated myths. Extracts from pre-publication previews: “Anyone interested in Zimbabwe’s recent history should read this book...thoroughly recommended…” — Prof. Ian Scoones, University of Sussex, UK, co-author of Zimbabwe’s Land Reform: Myths and Realities “Refreshingly daring, original, inventive and captivating,...highly controversial and likely to stir heated debate” — Prof. Micere Githae Mugo, Syracuse University, US, Kenyan poet, playwright and essayist, author of Writing and Speaking from the Heart of My Mind “Told with brutal honesty.

She is a gifted teacher, perceptive and critical: perhaps more important, she is also human . . . there is no question but that the magical path is a hard road that requires dedication, discrimination and a solid dose of common sense . . . if you are determined to follow the magical path, and if you employ these three qualities, you will be hard pressed indeed to find a better guide than Magical Knowledge."" RA Gilbert Magical Knowledge book I is the first in a series of three that takes the reader through the bends and twists of serious magical study. This book tackles some of the more pressing issues surrounding the early quest for knowledge from the world of magic, along with techniques, exercises and warnings for those ready to dip their toe in the scalding hot water of power. Using her usual no nonsense down to earth approach, McCarthy outlines in depth some of the rarely tackled issues and problems that face a serious modern magician, offering advice and reflections based on 30 years of practical work. The book follows no specific magical path; rather it takes the reader to the layers of consciousness beneath such paths and shows us the various techniques, powers and dynamics that underpin most Western Mystery schools and lodges. The reader is shown how ritual actually works, what an inner contact actually is, how to make visions work, how to turn an object into a magically charged implement, how to read tarot, how to clean and protect yourself, and most importantly of all, how to spot the bullshit. Josephine McCarthy is a seasoned occultist and author living in the Dartmoor National Park in the UK. She has taught and led magical groups in the USA and UK for many years, and has written a variety of magical fiction and non fiction. Her more recent publications include 'The Work of the Hierophant' and 'The Exorcist's Handbook'.",Josephine McCarthy,Religion & Spirituality,1906958440

The infamous Willie Lynch letter gives both African and Caucasian students and teachers some insight, concerning the brutal and inhumane psychology behind the African slave trade. The materialistic viewpoint of Southern plantation owners that slaver was a business and the victims of chattel slavery were merely pawns in an economic game of debauchery, cross-breeding, inter-racial rape and mental conditioning of a negroid race, they considered sub-human. Equally important is the international nature of the European economic, political and cultural climate that influenced the slave trade. Within the time scale of African History, it was a relatively short period, a mere one and a half centuries from the most intensive phase of the Atlantic slave trade to the advent of European administration and dominance. Long before that the Slave Coast had been chartered by the Portuguese and the people off the area west of Benin, between the volta River and Lagos, European traders traced a cultural history which linked them with the earliest Yoruba settlements to the north and eastern borders of Africa.",,Politics & Social Sciences,1930097220

Art critics gave them the name ""the School of Paris"" to set them apart from the French-born (and less talented) young artists of the period. Modigliani and Chagall eventually attained enormous worldwide popularity, but in those earlier days most School of Paris painters looked on Soutine as their most talented contemporary. Willem de Kooning proclaimed Soutine his favorite painter, and Jackson Pollack hailed him as a major influence. </p><p>Soutine arrived in Paris while many painters were experimenting with cubism, but he had no time for trends and fashions; like his art, Soutine was intense, demonic, and fierce. After the defeat of France by Hitler's Germany, the East European Jewish immigrants who had made their way to France for sanctuary were no longer safe. In constant fear of the French police and the German Gestapo, plagued by poor health and bouts of depression, Soutine was the epitome of the tortured artist.

They harassed us and our employees, tortured one of our workers, pulled a gun and threatened to kill me, slaughtered one of our oxen, roamed our fields with packs of hunting dogs, felled over 3,000 gum trees and burnt the entire farm to the ground. Our farm remains undesignated, unlisted and not required by the government for compulsory acquisition."" Catherine Buckle.<P>""""African Tears"" is the story of a white farmer in Zimbabwe, living side by side with ""war veterans"" for 7 months. The veterans claimed the small 1,000-acre farm belonged to their ancestors. For 7 months the squatters watched and intimidated, claiming the farm field by field, ""liberating"" the small stock dams and then the timber plantation. The farm was claimed as a war veterans headquarters and every weekend political meetings were held in the field below the house--with hundreds in attendance.<P> <P>Search your heart, revisit your past and squint into the future, into your greatest fears, your truest loves. Then understand that the emotional and psychological traumas one family has had to endure--in the face of unabashed greed, ignorance and savagery--has been pushed to its limits; their lives threatened; their farm stolen before their eyes and burned to the ground. Readers may well want to ask author Catherine Buckle, ""If things are so bad in Zimbabwe, why don't they leave?"" Her answer sums things up swiftly by asking, ""How much longer are we going to be made to pay for the sins of our fathers, grandfathers?"" She wants to know why history cannot be laid to rest. Blame for the injustices of the past has been placed squarely on the white population of Zimbabwe; she wants to know why the nation cannot accept this blame, admit that what went on 100 years ago was a disgrace, and move on. She admits openly that her patriotism is both old-fashioned and deep-set. ""I love my country, I love the people here, I love being here. That's why I wrote 'African Tears.' Perhaps, because I don't want to leave. I want to belong.""",Catherine Buckle,History,1919874275

136,The Quantum World: Quantum Physics for Everyone,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tIDsHLNjL.jpg,"<p>As Kenneth W. Ford shows us in <i>The Quantum World</i>, the laws governing the very small and the very swift defy common sense and stretch our minds to the limit. Drawing on a deep familiarity with the discoveries of the twentieth century, Ford gives an appealing account of quantum physics that will help the serious reader make sense of a science that, for all its successes, remains mysterious. In order to make the book even more suitable for classroom use, the author, assisted by Diane Goldstein, has included a new section of Quantum Questions at the back of the book. A separate answer manual to these 300+ questions is available; visit <i>The Quantum World</i> website for ordering information.</p><p>There is also a cloth edition of this book, which does not include the ""Quantum Questions"" included in this paperback edition.</p>",Kenneth W.

138,"Gurdjieff, A Beginner's Guide: How Changing The Way We React To Misplacing Our Keys Can Transform Our Lives",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YJ1iZOF0L.jpg,"<p>2011 Update<p> Are you ready for self-transformation? Many spiritual teachers promise transformation, but Georges Ivanovitch Gurdjieff delivers. Gurdjieff (1872-1949) was born in Alexandropol on the border of Russia and Turkey. Gurdjieff's teachings contain many concepts that, taken together are referred to as the Work. The idea behind the Work is that our first birth is our physical body, which is all we need to get through life. But we are capable of developing into something higher, just as an acorn can stay an acorn and die or develop into an Oak Tree, we can develop into something higher. Gurdjieff offers a radically original version of man and his potential for self-development. ""Gurdjieff, A Beginner's Guide: How Changing the Way We React To Misplacing Our Keys Can Transform Our Lives"" is a beginning guide to the teachings of Gurdjieff. Practical and eminently readable, it leads the reader through some of the main concepts necessary for self-transformation.",Gil Friedman,Politics & Social Sciences,091303827X
