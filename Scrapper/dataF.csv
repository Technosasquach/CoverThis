5,"This Book Is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don't Touch It (John Dies at the End)",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-RntCdC-L.jpg,"  From David Wong, the writer of the cult sensation  John Dies at the End, omes another terrifying and hilarious tale of almost Armageddon at the hands of two hopeless heroes.   Warning: You may have a huge, invisible spider living in your skull. THIS IS NOT A METAPHOR.    You will dismiss this as ridiculous fear-mongering. Dismissing things as ridiculous fear-mongering is, in fact, the first symptom of parasitic spider infection -- the creature stimulates skepticism, in order to prevent you from seeking a cure. That's just as well, since the ""cure"" involves learning what a chainsaw tastes like. You can't feel the spider, because it controls your nerve endings. You won't even feel it when it breeds. And it will breed.    Just stay calm, and remember that telling you about the spider situation is  not  the same as having caused it. I'm just the messenger. Even if I did sort of cause it. Either way, I won't hold it against you if you're upset. I know that's just the spider talking.  ""Like an episode of AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" written by Douglas Adams of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" …Imagine a mentally ill narrator describing the zombie apocalypse while drunk, and the end result is unlike any other book of the genre. Seriously, dude, touch it and read it."" – Washington Post    ""Kevin Smith's Clerks meets H.P. Lovecraft in this exceptional thriller… David Wong (Jason Pargin) is a fantastic author with a supernatural talent for humor. If you want a poignant, laugh-out-loud funny, disturbing, ridiculous, self-aware, socially relevant horror novel than  This Book is Full of Spiders: Seriously Dude, Don't Touch It  is the one and only book for you."" –SF Signal ",David Wong,Literature & Fiction,1250036658

The Beljanski method fights disease by targeting damaged or destabilized DNA in the body, allowing cells with healthy DNA to thrive. Beljanski, with his wife Monique, went on to develop natural compounds that enhance the body s resistance not only to degenerative diseases but also to the effects of environmental toxicity and the ravages of aging. Beljanski s compounds are now being studied at Columbia University, and other centers, where early findings support his theories.  In this book, the authors build on Mirko Beljanski s work to demonstrate how physiological and environmental factors both weaken the body s immune system and alter DNA functioning. They explain how aging exacerbates these effects, leading to cancer and other diseases. The authors then present the innovative compounds Beljanski developed and how they are able to prevent dysfunctional cells from multiplying. They also detail how to integrate essential nutritional strategies for maximizing health and fighting aging at the cellular level.",Hervé Janecek Ph.D.,"Health, Fitness & Dieting",1594772592
