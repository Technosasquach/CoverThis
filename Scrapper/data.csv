Surprisingly, the teachings of nineteenth-century Hasidic spiritual teachers offer a radically different Jewish theology that speaks directly to contemporary spiritual seekers whose faith has been shattered by both modernity and the Holocaust. These masters taught of interdependence, interconnectedness, selflessness, service and joy, anticipating the insights of contemporary science and twenty-first-century spirituality.</p><p>Mindfulness meditation, growing in popularity and influence throughout North America, directs practitioners to focus on their life experience in each moment. The spiritual practice offers the possibility of inner peace, fearlessness and expansive concern for the wellbeing of others.</p><p>These volumes bring the two together, providing a practical mindfulness method for applying the spiritual teachings of the Hasidic masters to everyday spiritual life. Covering the Five Books of Moses, they present accessible translations (many previously unavailable in English) of selections from <em>Kedushat Levi</em>, the Hasidic Torah commentary of Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berdichev, one of the most beloved Hasidic leaders. His Torah commentary emphasizes our spiritual capacity to transform consciousness and so our life experience. The selections are paired with Rabbi Jonathan Slater's commentaries to help the reader understand their message and suggestions for practice, based in mindfulness, grounding them in a contemporary life.</p>"

46,The Scientist as Rebel (New York Review Books),,"<p>From Galileo to todays amateur astronomers, scientists have been rebels, writes Freeman Dyson. Like artists and poets, they are free spirits who resist the restrictions their cultures impose on them. In their pursuit of natures truths, they are guided as much by imagination as by reason, and their greatest theories have the uniqueness and beauty of great works of art.<br><br>Dyson argues that the best way to understand science is by understanding those who practice it. He tells stories of scientists at work, ranging from Isaac Newtons absorption in physics, alchemy, theology, and politics, to Ernest Rutherfords discovery of the structure of the atom, to Albert Einsteins stubborn hostility to the idea of black holes. His descriptions of brilliant physicists like Edward Teller and Richard Feynman are enlivened by his own reminiscences of them. He looks with a skeptical eye at fashionable scientific fads and fantasies, and speculates on the future of climate prediction, genetic engineering, the colonization of space, and the possibility that paranormal phenomena may exist yet not be scientifically verifiable.<br><br>Dyson also looks beyond particular scientific questions to reflect on broader philosophical issues, such as the limits of reductionism, the morality of strategic bombing and nuclear weapons, the preservation of the environment, and the relationship between science and religion. These essays, by a distinguished physicist who is also a prolific writer, offer informed insights into the history of science and fresh perspectives on contentious current debates about science, ethics, and faith.</p>"

She is unashamedly, irrefutably, irrepressibly wild. That is, until she is snared by some very strange animals that look oddly like her, but they don't talk right, eat right, or play correctly. She's puzzled by their behavior and their insistence on living in these strange concrete structures: there's no green here, no animals, no trees, no rivers. Now she lives in the comfort of civilization. But will civilization get comfortable with her?<br><br>In her debut picture book, Hughes brings an uncanny humor to her painterly illustrations.

59,Stephen Irwin,,"Artist Stephen Irwin (1959-2010) worked in sculpture, drawing and installation, but he is best known for his work altering vintage pornography: using steel wool to rub off a magazine page's shiny coating and taking most of the picture with it, Irwin lovingly isolated fragments of the image. Censoring much of what might have been shocking about the original photographs, Irwin's images suggest instead a more expansive erotic landscape of tenderness and perversion, chastity and lasciviousness.<br/>Before his death, Irwin asked that his ashes be compacted and turned into graphite for pencils. Although this ultimate performance never materialized, the gesture and thought is a testament to his creative and conceptual mind, one that fully grasped the delicacy and absurdity of life."

64,Fallacies of the Anti Hadith argument,,"In society today, there are many individuals and groups who seek to eliminate Islam in its pure and true form. The introduction of heretical innovations and anti Islamic customs have seen a moral decay in the hearts of the Muslims.

Ignorance of the Islamic sciences is prevalent among the Muslim youth of today. The majority fail to differentiate between what is considered permissible and that which is impermissible. It is these vulnerable minds which the rejectors of Hadith wish to influence with their Western influenced philosophies and practices. It is an obligation on the learned to eradicate the falsehoods of such movements and educate the masses regarding the path of truth and guidance.

68,Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning,,"<b>A brilliant, haunting, and profoundly original portrait of the defining tragedy of our time.</b><br><br>In this epic history of extermination and survival, Timothy Snyder presents a new explanation of the great atrocity of the twentieth century, and reveals the risks that we face in the twenty-first.&#160; Based on new sources from eastern Europe and forgotten testimonies from Jewish survivors, <i>Black Earth</i> recounts the mass murder of the Jews as an event that is still close to us, more comprehensible than we would like to think, and thus all the more terrifying.&#160; <br><br>The Holocaust began in a dark but accessible place, in Hitler's mind, with the thought that the elimination of Jews would restore balance to the planet and allow Germans to win the resources they desperately needed.&#160; Such a worldview could be realized only if Germany destroyed other states, so Hitler's aim was a colonial war in Europe itself.&#160; In the zones of statelessness, almost all Jews died.&#160; A few people, the righteous few, aided them, without support from institutions.&#160; Much of the new research in this book is devoted to understanding these extraordinary individuals.&#160; The almost insurmountable difficulties they faced only confirm the dangers of state destruction and ecological panic.&#160; These men and women should be emulated, but in similar circumstances few of us would do so.&#160; <br><br>By overlooking the lessons of the Holocaust, Snyder concludes, we have misunderstood modernity and endangered the future.&#160; The early twenty-first century is coming to resemble the early twentieth, as growing preoccupations with food and water accompany ideological challenges to global order.&#160; Our world is closer to Hitler's than we like to admit, and saving it requires us to see the Holocaust as it was -- and ourselves as we are.&#160; <br><br>Groundbreaking, authoritative, and utterly absorbing, <i>Black Earth</i> reveals a Holocaust that is not only history but warning."

82,"London Calling: Britain, the BBC World Service and the Cold War",,"<p>From its inception in 1932, overseas broadcasting by the BBC quickly became an essential adjunct to British diplomatic and foreign policy objectives. For this reason, the World Service was considered the primary means of engaging with attitudes and opinions behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War. Although funded by government Grant-in-Aid, the Service's editorial independence was enshrined in the BBC's Charter, Licence and Agreement. <i>London Calling</i> explores the delicate balance of power that lay in the relations between Whitehall and the World Service during the Cold War.</p><p>This book also assesses the nature and impact of the World Service's programmes on listeners living in the Eastern bloc countries. In doing so, it traces the evolution of overseas broadcasting from Britain alongside the political, diplomatic and fiscal challenges that the country faced right up to the Suez crisis and the 1956 Hungarian uprising. These were defining experiences for the United Kingdom's international broadcaster that, as a consequence, helped shape and define the BBC World Service as we know it today. <i>London Calling</i> is an important study for anyone interested in the media and foreign policy histories of Great Britain or the history of the Cold War more generally.</p><p>Winner of the Longman <i>History Today </i>Book of the Year Award 2015</p>"
