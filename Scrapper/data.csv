Several years in the making, this 360-page book is unique from others for two reasons: it is from a former passionate Arminian who knows those arguments well, and it treats these doctrines in an expositional manner instead of the usual topical fashion. After laying the all important foundation of how we should approach these doctrines, it then exposits the classic passages of Scripture that present them. A very special chapter, “The Test of History (Jude 3),” carefully traces the history of both Arminianism and Calvinism, demonstrating the consequences of both and the historical orthodoxy of the latter.",Dr. J.

The two now issued are confined to the second half of the military life of the great captain, and are the concluding volumes of the History of the Art of War, begun by the author in 1890 with the life of A lexander. Political events are barely touched on ;personal matters only to throw light on Napoleon scharacter as a soldier. While narrating in much detail the campaigns from 1808 to 1815, Volumes III. and IV. furnish a study of the causes which led to Napoleon sdownfall, as Volumes I. and II. contain the story of his amazing rise to power. Although a part of the larger History, yet this military life of Napoleon is of itself a complete work. The subject is so vast that to write double the number of pages would have been far easier. To compress the matter into its present size has obliged the author to sacrifice diction to facts, and to reduce many chapters to what appears crude. All useless words, such, e. g., as titles, have been omitted.

McGee began as a graffiti artist on the streets of San Francisco, working under such tags as Ray Fong, Twist and Twisto, and his work since then has hugely expanded the terms of both street art and contemporary art. The freshness of McGee’s work stems in part from his virtuoso handling and consolidation of a whole panoply of influences, from hobo art, sign painting and graffiti to comics, Beat literature and much else. His extraordinary skill as a draughtsman is energized by his insistence on pushing at the parameters of art--his work can be shockingly informal in the gallery and surprisingly elegant on the street--and by his keen nose for social malaise.<BR>This volume revisits McGee’s most influential installations in art spaces, and considers the evolution of his aesthetic within institutional settings. Previously unseen photographs by Craig Costello document the artist’s work on the streets of San Francisco in the early 90s, highlighting the contributions of his friends and mentors. Also included are images from the artist’s famous slide lecture, compiled and refined over the past 20 years, and an oral history of the Bay Area’s Mission School by McGee’s friends, mentors and collaborators. Featuring 450 images, including many never before published, the book is designed by the artist in collaboration with Conny Purtill.",Alex Baker,Arts & Photography,1935202855

According to quantum physics, reality occurs on two levels: possibility and actuality. Goswami uses this same duality to explore what he calls ""quantum thinking,"" which focuses on two levels of thinking&#8212;the conscious mind of actuality and the unconscious mind of possibility. He then poses questions that probe the wellspring of creation that exists in each of us. What is creativity? Can anyone be creative? What kinds of creativity are there? And through this inquiry, he lays out a guidebook for understanding the power of the mind to access creativity in a whole new way. Combining the art of creativity with the objectivity of science, Quantum Creativity uses empirical data to support this new method of thinking and outlines how to harness our innate abilities in order to live more creatively.

Steven Roger Fischer offers the first English-language history of Easter Island in <I>Island at the End of the World</I>, a fascinating chronicle of adversity, triumph, and the enduring monumentality of the island's stone guards. <BR><BR>A small canoe with Polynesians brought the first humans to Easter Island in 700 CE, and when boat travel in the South Pacific drastically decreased around 1500, the Easter Islanders were forced to adapt in order to survive their isolation. Adaptation, Fischer asserts,&#160;was a continuous thread in the life of Easter Island: the first European visitors, who viewed the awe-inspiring monolithic busts in 1722, set off hundreds of years of violent warfare, trade, and disease&#8212;from the smallpox, wars, and Great Death that decimated the island to the late nineteenth-century Catholic missionaries who tried to ""save"" it to a despotic Frenchman who declared sole claim of the island and was soon killed by the remaining 111 islanders. The rituals, leaders, and religions of the Easter Islanders evolved with all of these events, and Fischer is just as attentive to the island's cultural developments as he is to its foreign invasions. <BR><BR>Bringing his history into the modern era, Fischer examines the colonization and annexation of Easter Island by Chile, including the Rapanui people's push for&#160;civil rights in 1964 and 1965, by which they gained full citizenship and freedom of movement on the island. As travel to and interest in the island rapidly expand, <I>Island at the End of the World</I> is an essential history of this mysterious site.",Steven Roger Fischer,History,1861892829

Before emigrating in 1939, Gertrud Goldschmidt (Gego) studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart under Paul Bonatz, and, as a result, the construction of structures and the shaping of space took on great significance in her artistic work, which takes line as a theme in its own right.

Do read the book. It is important. It is accessible. It is well presented. It is also fun.'</i><br><BR>- Raphie Kaplinsky, <i>Technovation</i><P><i>'It was Carlota Perez in the early 1980s, who designated the major changes in technology systems, such as mechanization, electrification or computerization, as ''changes of techno-economic paradigm'' a designation which has since been widely adopted. In this book she offers many new insights into these complex processes of social, economic and technological change. She traces the interactions between that part of the economy commonly known as ''financial capital'' and the evolution of technologies. Although this was an important aspect of Schumpeter's original work, it has been neglected by his followers, so that the book fills an important gap in the literature on business cycles and innovations. I most strongly commend it to all those attempting to understand the past and future evolution of technology and the economy.'</i><br><BR>- Christopher Freeman, SPRU - Science and Technology Policy Research, University of Sussex, UK and Maastricht University, The Netherlands<P><i>'Before I read this book I thought that the history of technology was - to borrow Churchill's phrase - merely ''one damned thing after another''. Not so. Carlota Perez shows us that historically technological revolutions arrive with remarkable regularity, and that economies react to them in predictable phases. Her argument provides much needed perspective not just on history, but on our own times. And especially on our own information revolution.'</i><br><BR>- W. Brian Arthur, Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico<P><i>'This is a smashing book. It informs us that the emphasis on finance that marked the excesses of the 1990s has historically occurred with each great wave of new technologies, only to later shift the focus back to production. Fascinating. May the shift happen again soon.'</i><br><BR>- Richard R. Nelson, Columbia University<P><i>Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital</i> presents a novel interpretation of the good and bad times in the economy, taking a long-term perspective and linking technology and finance in an original and convincing way.<br><P>Carlota Perez draws upon Schumpeter's theories of the clustering of innovations to explain why each technological revolution gives rise to a paradigm shift and a 'New Economy' and how these 'opportunity explosions', focused on specific industries, also lead to the recurrence of financial bubbles and crises. These findings are illustrated with examples from the past two centuries: the industrial revolution, the age of steam and railways, the age of steel and electricity, the emergence of mass production and automobiles, and the current information revolution/knowledge society.<br><P>By analyzing the changing relationship between finance capital and production capital during the emergence, diffusion and assimilation of new technologies throughout the global economic system, this seminal book sheds new light on some of the most pressing economic problems of today.<br><P>A bold interpretation of how the changing relationship between technological advances and financial capital shapes the patterns of economic cycles, this path-breaking book will provide essential insights for business leaders, policymakers, academics and others concerned with managing change in the world economy.",Carlota Perez,Business & Money,1843763311

55,Ten Dates Every Catholic Should Know: The Divine Surprises and Chastisements That Shaped the Church and Changed the World,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vi0tXdtuL.jpg,"<p>Here are the saints and sinners, popes and kings that God used to shape his Church and change the world. You ll meet Clovis and Charlemagne, Luther and Pope Leo, Suleiman and St. Francis, the Arians, the Franks, the Huguenots, and others whose sins or sacrifices altered the course of history.</p> <p>Here, too, are the wars and plagues, the ideas and institutions -- and, yes, the miracles that gave birth to our Christian civilization and often threatened to doom it. Experience the battles of Tours and Lepanto, the Crusades, the Russian Revolution, and Fatima, the miracle that foretold (and offered a way to prevent) the conflicts that killed millions in the twentieth century.</p> <p>Wars and terrorism have rendered the first years of our new century no less bloody. Has God now abandoned us?</p> <p><em>Ten Dates Every Catholic Should Know</em> finds the answer in history: from the first days of the Christian era, at key moments when civilization hung in the balance, God has intervened sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically but ever and always he has come forward himself or given strength to those who were faithful to him. Consider, for example:</p> <ul>  Constantine, the pagan general who, in a desperate hour, saw a vision that made him a Christian and led to the conversion of the entire Roman Empire  Pope St. Leo, who confronted Attila the Hun face-to-face and, without sword or dagger, turned back this Scourge of God and all his murderous hordes  The surprising victories of the outgunned armies that thrust back the Moors, the Turks, and the barbarians just when Christendom faced annihilation  Plus: St. Genevieve, Pepin the Short, Pope St. Pius V, St. Margaret Mary, and countless others who, in crucial moments, were called by God to save his people and give new life to our culture and his Church.</ul> <p><em>Ten Dates Every Catholic Should Know</em> is essential reading for any Catholic who wants to understand the history of our Faith. But it will give you more than knowledge: you ll close this book with renewed confidence that no matter how dark and dangerous the times may be, God has never abandoned his people . . . and never will.</p>",Diane Moczar,Christian Books & Bibles,1933184159

59,Stepping Out of Self-Deception: The Buddha's Liberating Teaching of No-Self,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415UFXh2C0L.jpg,"<i>Anatta</i> is the Buddhist teaching on the nonexistence of a permanent, independent self. It&rsquo;s a notoriously puzzling and elusive concept, usually leading to such questions as, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t have a self, who&rsquo;s reading this sentence?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not that there&rsquo;s no self there, says Rodney Smith. It&rsquo;s just that the self that is reading this sentence is a configuration of elements that at one time did not exist and which at some point in the future will disperse. Even in its present existence, it&rsquo;s more a temporary arrangement of components rather than something solid. <i>Anatta </i>is a truth the Buddha considered to be absolutely essential to his teaching. Smith shows that understanding this truth can change the way you relate to the world, and that the perspective of selflessness is critically important for anyone involved in spiritual practice. Seeing it can be the key to getting past the idea that spirituality has something to do with self-improvement, and to accessing the joy of deep insight into reality.",Rodney Smith,Religion & Spirituality,1590307291

This book explores the tactics, organizational structure and equipment of the brave Italian resistance fighters, who knew exactly what was at stake when operating against their German occupiers. Beginning with low-level sabotage and assassinations, the groups grew until spring 1944 when they numbered around 100,000, and as the Allies advanced to the Gothic line, a remarkable, unified partisan command structure was created. The partisans began to work in close co-ordination with the Allies, receiving British SOE and American OSS liaison teams as well as supplies of weapons. The German response was eye-watering in its ferocity and brutality, as the SS and Italian RSI looked to eradicate the partisans once and for all when the Allied advance stalled in Autumn 1944. But when the Allies made their final breakthrough in the last weeks of the war the partisans rose in force to pile the pressure on the retreating Wehrmacht. </p><p>From an expert on Italian military history in World War II, this work provides an exhaustively researched, sumptuously illustrated guide to the men and women who fought a desperate struggle against occupation, as well as the German and Italian fascist security forces unleashed against them.</p>",Pier Battistelli,Arts & Photography,1472808932

111,The Demon's Sermon on the Martial Arts: And Other Tales,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XPEF0LkLL.jpg,"This collection of parables written by an eighteenth-century samurai is a classic of martial arts literature. The tales are concerned with themes such as perception of conflict, self-transformation, the cultivation of chi (life energy), and understanding yin and yang. Some of the parables seem light and fanciful, but they offer the reader valuable lessons on the fundamental principles of the martial arts; &ldquo;The Mysterious Technique of the Cat&rdquo; is iconic. <br><br>The &ldquo;demon&rdquo; in the title story refers to the mythical tengu, who guard the secrets of swordsmanship. A swordsman travels to Mt. Kurama, famous for being inhabited by tengu, and in a series of conversations he learns about mushin (no-mind), strategy, the transformation of chi, and how the path of the sword leads to the understanding of life itself. <br><br>The author, Issai Chozanshi, had a deep understanding of Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto, as well as insight into the central role of chi in the universe&mdash;points that are succinctly explained in William Scott Wilson&rsquo;s fine introduction and extensive endnotes. This is essential reading for anyone who wants to truly understand the philosophical underpinnings of martial arts, and how these principles relate to our existence.",William Scott Wilson,Sports & Outdoors,1590309898
112,Lady Fatima Masuma of Qum,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mRKSSGM4L.jpg,"Lady Fatima Masuma was the daughter of the 7th Imam, Imam Musa al-Kadhm and the sister of the 8th Imam, Imam Ali al-Rida. She was a noble lady who dedicated her life to Islam and Allah. She was highly gifted and due to the training of her father and brother, she has achieved a high reputation in history for her knowledge and piety. She was only six years old when her father was arrested by Harun (the 6th Abbasid Caliph) and thereafter, she was brought up under the care of her brother, Imam al-Rida for twenty-one years. In the year 200 A.H, Ma'mun (the 7th Abbasid Caliph) forced the Imam to move from Madina to Khurasan, in Iran. And so, Lady Fatima Masuma was once more separated from her guardian. In the year 201 A.H, she decided to leave Madina and travel to Khurasan to be at the side of her brother, intending to help him in his mission to preach Islam. But regrettably, she never reached him. The caravan that she was travelling with, was ambushed at Saweh, where she had to witness the brutal killing of her close family members. As a result, she can be compared to Lady Zaynab, who suffered a similar plight in Karbala. Lady Fatima Masuma was taken ill at Saweh. From here, the Shi`a of the nearby Qum brought her to their city, where she spent her last few days, before passing away during the month of Rabi al-Thani in 201 A.H. Lady Fatima Masuma is buried in Qum, Iran. Due to her blessed presence and patronage, the city has grown into a centre of Shi`a learning; a destination for thousands of Muslim students from over 80 countries.",Masuma Jaffer,Religion & Spirituality,1507625375

115,Reinterpreting a Native American Identity: Examining the Lumbee through the Peoplehood Model,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xO-XofP7L.jpg,"<span><span style=""font-style:italic;"">Reinterpreting a Native American Identity </span><span>discusses the ongoing and morphing politics<br />behind the federal government&rsquo;s denial of full Lumbee tribal recognition. At the core of<br />the Lumbee struggle for federal recognition are issues of cultural authenticity, racism, misrecognition, and assimilation grounded in a longer history of colonialism. Beyond merely describing why denial has continually occurred, this book</span><span style=""font-style:italic;""> </span><span>takes an American Indian Studies approach through the use of the Peoplehood Model developed by Tom Holm et al as a way of arguing for a better and more consistent recognition process grounded in Indigenous methodology and worldview. The Peoplehood Model is juxtaposed with the Western Colonial Model, the process that describes efforts to assimilate another culture. This book</span><span style=""font-style:italic;""> </span><span>centers on the four aspects of Peoplehood&mdash;language, sacred history, territory/place, and ceremonial cycle&mdash;and shows how these interrelated concepts inform the Lumbee identity and worldview vis-&agrave;-vis the federal government&rsquo;s longstanding refusal to fully recognize the tribe. The government&rsquo;s arguments, derived from the Western Colonial Model, are countered and challenged by Lumbee-centered knowledge and history regarding identity within a syncretistic system of survival as an Indigenous group. </span></span><br /><br /><span><span>This study illustrates that the tribe&rsquo;s indigenous language has not been fully lost to assimilation, as the federal government argues, but that Lumbee English is marked by linguistic adaptation, which retains a Native American worldview in use and meaning. It further demonstrates that the Lumbee have maintained a sacred history and revere their homeland as the &ldquo;promised land,&rdquo; contrary to the position periodically espoused by the federal government. Lastly, this book argues that the system used to restrict Native American religion harkens back to Roman Law, adopted through the writings of Thomas Aquinas, later synthesized by Dominican theologian Franciscus de Victoria and eventually elevated to papal hierocratic ideology adopted by many colonizing countries. While Lumbee religion is Christian-centric, it is also intertwined with Indigenous spiritual and healing practices which are not subsumed by Christianity but are placed as equally valid within a spiritual system.</span></span>",Eric Hannel,Law,1498522114

The anti-price rise movement (APRM) took even the leaders of socialist and communist parties - of which many of the women were a part - by surprise. People hailed the movement as the new women's movement, the media gave the protesting women and their chosen symbols - the rolling pin, the tin of ghee, the kitchen ladle - wide coverage. Spearheading the action, the Mahngai Pratikar Samjukta Mahila Samiti, a joint front of women from different political groups, led raids on traders, inspected ration shops, and fought to have hoarded goods released. In 1975, the declaration of a state of emergency brought this vibrant movement to an abrupt halt. This book traces the nature of women's political participation and militancy in the APRM, and relates it to their everyday experiences within the context of the broader political scene in India in the 1970s. It documents the movement and examines its genesis, its forms of protest, its structure and method of organization and raises key questions about our understanding of particular movements and their relevance to political practice.",Nandita Gandhi,Business & Money,8185107378

The author explains how the church fathers knowingly incorporated pagan elements into the Christian faith to ease the transition to the new religion. Rather than tear down the pagan temples in Britain, Pope Gregory the Great advised Saint Augustine of Canterbury to add the pagan rituals into the mix of Christian practices and transform the pagan temples into churches. Instead of religious conversion, it was simply a matter of convincing the populace to include Jesus in their current religious practices. <BR> <BR>Providing extensive documentation, Walter shows which major calendar days of the Christian year are founded on pagan rituals and myths, including the high holidays of Easter and Christmas. Examining hagiographic accounts of the saints, he reveals the origin of these symbolic figures in the deities worshipped in pagan Europe for centuries. He also explores how the identities of saints and pagan figures became so intermingled that some saints were transformed into pagan incarnations, such as Mary Magdalene&rsquo;s conversion into one of the Celtic Ladies of the Lake. <BR> <BR>In revealing the pagan roots of many Christian figures, stories, and rituals, Walter provides a new understanding of the evolution of religious belief.",Philippe Walter,Religion & Spirituality,1620553686

In the book Smith describes how the special combinatio of the stars themselves, a writing genius, and the ""perfect"" sponsor, produced a one-of-a-kind program melding laughs and patriotim during ne of America's drkest hours. Jim and Marian Jordan somehow hooked up with thw writing genius of Don Quinn, and the unparalleled support of the S>C> Johnson(Wax) Company to produce an entertaining, funny series of programs with an uwavering mssage--America was in right , the men(and women) in the military deserved unflagging support, and the folks at home had a vital role to play, assuring the ultimate victory. The story is told via excerpts fro scores of broadcasts enhanced by the author's observations. An account of the difficult , but ultimately successful, efforts of the Government and of the broadcast industry to adapt to Wartime conditions provides an illuminating backdrop to the story. Fifteen photographs illuminate the book. The McGee's messages, while always supportive of the War efort, were sometimes poignant. An example is Molly's post-War reminder in support of the National War Fund, an agency devoted to providing recreational care and maintenance of morale for the military until they returned home:""We gave our boys a warm han when they left.

With helpful updates throughout, the new edition features five new chapters on Appreciative Inquiry applied in real congregations. <br /><br />When First Presbyterian Church in Altadena, California, was asked to provide a mission study report for its pastor nominating committee, the congregation was afraid they would find themselves engaging in busy work and producing a report that would wind up in a file gathering dust. They then asked professor Mark Lau Branson to consult with them on writing this report. He invited them to join in a process of Appreciative Inquiry--a transformational organization change process--which resulted in a major shift in congregational conversations and a new sense of hope. Memories, Hopes, and Conversations recounts the experience of First Presbyterian and outlines a process that any congregation can utilize to harness the energies of the congregation at all levels of its common life. Branson first leads readers through the foundations of Appreciative Inquiry and bracingly explores biblical texts for understanding the practice in a faith context. He then outlines and illustrates a four-step process--Initiate, Inquire, Imagine, Innovate--that creatively employs constructive conversations and questions to evoke storytelling and spur imaginations. Branson persuasively demonstrates how concentrating on needs and problems can mire a congregation in discouragement and distract it from noticing innate strengths. By focusing on memories of the congregation at its best, members are able to construct &quot;provocative proposals&quot; to help shape the church&rsquo;s future. Grounded in solid theory and real-life practice, Memories, Hopes, and Conversations is a groundbreaking work of narrative leadership and the first book to apply the principles of Appreciative Inquiry to the lives of congregations.</span></span>",Mark Lau Branson,Christian Books & Bibles,1566992885

167,Stories Rabbits Tell,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EvMsDbLzL.jpg,"Revered as a symbol of fertility, sexuality, purity and childhood, beloved as a children’s pet and widely represented in the myths, art and collectibles of almost every culture, the rabbit is one of the most popular animals known to humans. Ironically, it has also been one of the most misunderstood and abused. Indeed, the rabbit is the only animal that our culture adores as a pet, idolizes as a storybook hero and slaughters for commercial purposes.<br><br> <b>Stories Rabbits Tell</b> takes a comprehensive look at the rabbit as a wild animal, ancient symbol, pop culture icon, commercial “product” and domesticated pet. In so doing, the book explores how one species can be simultaneously adored as a symbol of childhood (think Peter Rabbit), revered as a symbol of female sexuality (e.g., Playboy Bunnies), dismissed as a “dumb bunny” in domesticity and loathed as a pest in the wild. The authors counter these stereotypes with engaging analyses of real rabbit behavior, drawn both from the authors' own experience and from academic studies, and place those behaviors in the context of current debates about animal consciousness. In a detailed investigative section, the authors also describe conditions in the rabbit meat, fur, pet and vivisection industries, and raise important questions about the ethics of treating rabbits as we do. <br><br> The first book of its kind, <b>Stories Rabbits Tell</b> provides invaluable information and insight into the life and history of an animal whom many love, but whom most of us barely know. As such, it is a key addition to the current thinking on animal emotions, intelligences and welfare, and the way that human perceptions influence the treatment of individual species.",Susan E.

175,Beowulf - Autotypes Of The Unique Cotton Manuscript Vitellius A XV In The British Museum,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41en48vmDmL.jpg,"PRELIMINARY NOTICE. MR. FURNIVALL, at p. 12 of the Eleventh Report of the Com mittee of the Early English Text Society September, 1879, says as follows On Prof. Skeats receiving, to the Committees great pleasure, his well-earned and well-deserved reward of the Anglo- Saxon Professorship at Cambridge, he proposed that the Society should autotype the unique MS. of the great Anglo-Saxon epic of Beowulf. The Committee, relying on finding a translator and editor of the- text, adopted Prof. Skeats suggestion. The MS. was photographed by Mr. Praetorius he has delivered some of the autotypes, and undertakes to hand in the whole early next year. Part I. of the book is now in hand, and will be issued for 1880 in 1881. Before that Report was printed, I had promised Mr. Furnivall to act as editor. I collated the autotypes in the August and September of 1880, with the MS. as well as with the two transcripts of it, made nearly a hundred years ago the one by, the other for, the first editor of the poem, G. J. Thorkelin which now belong to the Large Royal Library at Copenhagen, but which, on our directors application, were kindly sent to the British Museum. After my return to Germany, however, having to perform the duties of Dean to the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Berlin for 1880- 1881, I was unable to go on with the Beoufrilf before the long vacation of 1881. My transliteration of the MS. was in type by the end of August, 1882, and I read the proof-sheets of it with the MS. in the earlier part of the following month. The transliteration contains more than can be read in the Facsimile or even in the MS., inasmuch as it has been my endeavour to give the text as far as possible in that condition in which it stood in the MS. a century ago. The MS. Cotton MSS. Vitellius A. xv. did not suffer so much from the fire of 1731 itself as from its consequences, which would, without doubt, have been avoided if the MS. had been at once rebound as carefully as it has been rebound in our days. Even when Thorkelin used it, the edges of a few pages only had crumbled off. But much morewas gone by Kembles time, and many letters and words which Kemble still saw are now no longer in existence. Further losses have been put a stop to by the new binding but, admirably as this was done, the binder could not help covering some letters or portions of letters in every back page with the edge of the paper which now surrounds every parchment leaf. I grudged no pains in trying to decipher as much of what is covered as possible. When, in my notes, I simply state that something is covered, I always mean to say that, by holding the leaf to the light, I was able to read it nevertheless. In case I could not make out what is covered distinctly, I always add a remark to that effect. Both in the front pages and in the back pages transparent paper was employed by the binder, which, although it does not prevent the reader of the MS...",Julius Zupitza,Literature & Fiction,1406720577

A devastating blaze soon engulfed the thousand-year-old building, severely damaging the interior.<BR><BR>When the firemen had put out the flames, a sodden pile of ashes was discovered, all that remained of one of the jewels of Islamic art&#151;the Minbar of Saladin.

Allegiances run from the general (Chicago versus New York style, Neapolitan versus Roman) to the particular (Pepe&#39;s versus Sally&#39;s, Gino&#39;s East versus Pizzeria Uno), and new interpretations ever extend the pizza frontier.In AMERICAN PIE, master bread baker Peter Reinhart follows the trail from Italy to the States, capturing the stories behind the greatest artisanal pizzas of the Old World and the New. Beginning his journey in Genoa, Reinhart scours the countryside in search of the fabled focaccia col formaggio. He next heads to Rome to sample the famed seven-foot-long pizza al taglio, and then to Naples for the archetypal pizza napoletana. Back in America, the hunt resumes in the unlikely locale of Phoenix, Arizona, where Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco has convinced many that his pie sets the new standard in the country. The pizza mecca of New Haven, grilled pizza in Providence, the deep-dish pies of Chicago, California-style pizza in San Francisco and Los Angeles&mdash;these are just a few of the tasty attractions on Reinhart&#39;s epic tour. Returning to the kitchen, Reinhart gives a master class on pizza-making techniques and provides more than 60 recipes for doughs, sauces and toppings, and the pizzas that bring them all together. His insatiable curiosity and gift for storytelling make AMERICAN PIE essential reading for those who aspire to make great pizza at home, as well as for anyone who enjoys the thrill of the hunt.

As a young convert to the new movement of theosophy, he served as private secretary to its co-founder, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, and after founding the European section of the Theosophical Society edited its London journal, <i>Lucifer</i>, for many years. Mead's initial interest in theosophy and Hinduism soon blossomed into a lifelong and wide-ranging engagement with the texts of Gnosticism, neo-Platonism, and hermeticism.

Water on Tap explores examples of such conflicts in six national settings (France, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand), focusing on a central question: how were rights and regulation mobilised to address the demands of redistribution and recognition? Two modes of governance emerged: managed liberalisation and participatory democracy, often in hybrid forms that complicated simple oppositions between public and private, commodity and human right. The case studies examine the effects of transnational and domestic regulatory frameworks shaping the provision of urban water services, bilateral investment treaties and the contributions of non-state actors such as transnational corporations, civil society organisations and social movement activists. The conceptual framework developed can be applied to a wide range of transnational governance contexts.",Bronwen Morgan,Law,1107411831

244,Human Nature & Jewish Thought: Judaism's Case for Why Persons Matter (Library of Jewish Ideas),http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bY8AJ-JHL.jpg,"<p>This book explores one of the great questions of our time: How can we preserve our sense of what it means to be a person while at the same time accepting what science tells us to be true―namely, that human nature is continuous with the rest of nature? What, in other words, does it mean to be a person in a world of things? Alan Mittleman shows how the Jewish tradition provides rich ways of understanding human nature and personhood that preserve human dignity and distinction in a world of neuroscience, evolutionary biology, biotechnology, and pervasive scientism. These ancient resources can speak to Jewish, non-Jewish, and secular readers alike.</p><p>Science may tell us what we are, Mittleman says, but it cannot tell us who we are, how we should live, or why we matter. Traditional Jewish thought, in open-minded dialogue with contemporary scientific perspectives, can help us answer these questions. Mittleman shows how, using sources ranging across the Jewish tradition, from the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud to more than a millennium of Jewish philosophy. Among the many subjects the book addresses are sexuality, birth and death, violence and evil, moral agency, and politics and economics. Throughout, Mittleman demonstrates how Jewish tradition brings new perspectives to―and challenges many current assumptions about―these central aspects of human nature.</p><p>A study of human nature in Jewish thought and an original contribution to Jewish philosophy, this is a book for anyone interested in what it means to be human in a scientific age.</p>",Alan L.

This book's brief review shows traditional Living Wills do NOT remove these fears. Yet two legal rights let you forgo spoon feeding--if someday you suffer from Advanced Dementia. Refusing life-sustaining treatment is a well-accepted choice, but this decision alone cannot help patients whose devastated brains are in healthy bodies. What can? <b>Natural Dying</b>, which includes forgoing spoon feeding while receiving all Comfort Care.<p>Some argue spoon feeding is basic care and thus obligatory. This book presents clinical reasons why spoon feeding is medical treatment. A Catholic priest/health ethicist's guest essay explains why religious patients may refuse spoon feeding if a condition makes treatment extraordinary or disproportionate. --Comforting arguments, if you wish to respect the sanctity of life but do not want to prolong dying if there is no other life-sustaining treatment to forgo. <p>The companion book, <b>Peaceful Transitions: Stories of Success and Compassion</b>, describes the powerful opposition to Natural Dying. This book shows how to overcome their challenges to make sure others will honor your <i>Known Wishes </i>by creating your ''ironclad strategy'': <p>How to select an appropriate proxy/agent. <p>How to complete several forms (and why all are necessary). <p>How to alert 9-1-1 first responders and make your most current forms available when critical decisions need to be made.<p>A story shows how a hypothetical person's ironclad strategy successfully overcame a series of challenges. He started planning at age 45 and attained his goal of a <i>PEACEFUL TRANSITION</i> that was also <i>TIMELY: neither prolonged nor premature</i> at age 90.<p>To construct the <b>Four Pillars</b> of your ironclad strategy NOW, while you still can:<p>I. YOU express your specific Known Wishes in a clear and convincing <b>Natural Dying--Living Will</b>. This legal form lists your criteria for future conditions so your proxy/agent and physician will know precisely WHEN you would want Natural Dying. Either sort the optional <b>My Way Cards</b> or use the <i>Criteria of Advanced Dementia for Natural Dying</i> listed in the companion book, <b>Stories</b>.<p>II. Your PHYSICIAN and you sign two forms to verify your informed consent... for <b>Natural Dying</b>, so you can avoid lingering for months to years in Advanced Dementia, and for <b> Sedation to Unconsciousness</b>, so you can avoid days to weeks of unending, unbearable pain and suffering.<p>III. Your PROXY/AGENT and you sign an <i>irrevocable agreement</i>, to give your proxy/agent extra power to make sure all will honor your <i>Known Wishes</i>.<p>IV. A NOTARY PUBLIC affirms your sworn or affirmed <i>Natural Dying Affidavit</i>, to give your proxy/agent a ''trump card'' if needed to get others to honor your <i>Known Wishes</i>.<p>The book also notes the threat of new Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) forms that are highly promoted. The problem? Many POLST forms can override your prior, diligently created Living Will. The book offers a specific strategy to overcome this threat.<p>No group of people has more urgency to establish an ironclad strategy than those whose risk of dementia is high. Here is information on how readers can determine--in private--if they may have just a little dementia or mild cognitive impairment.<p>If your goals are ambitious for the last chapter of life, it will take extra effort to deal with all these challenges. But after you complete your ironclad strategy, you can relax and enjoy the rest of your life without worrying if others will force you to suffer a <i>premature or prolonged dying.</i>",Stanley A.

Still, interest in Mary is high, as evidenced by retreats, pilgrimages, liturgical formulations, and church discussions on her. Many Christians are hearing new wisdom in her <i>Magnificat</i> and are searching for ways to integrate her into their lives of faith.<br /><br />Although we inevitably look at Mary from a twenty-first-century perspective, in this book Duckworth shows that our appreciation will be deeply enriched if we remember the sources that have influenced our tradition and try to comprehend the grand sweep of Marian devotion. As descendants of that tradition, we can look to Mary not only as the mother of our Lord but as the mother of a growing, changing church that is finding its way to a contemporary appreciation of her many dimensions. Duckworth addresses six of those dimensions―Mary as prophet, matriarch, theologian, disciple, intercessor, and paradigm―in this compelling work that combines theology, history, devotion, and meditation on biblical texts.",Penelope Duckworth,Christian Books & Bibles,1561012602

The 24th Tirthankar, Lord Mahavira lived in ca. 6th century BC. One of the main characteristics of Jain belief is the emphasis on the immediate consequences of one's behavior.<BR><BR>Jains are a small but influential religious minority with at least 4.2 million practitioners in modern India and more in growing immigrant communities in the United States, Western Europe, the Far East and elsewhere. Jains continue to sustain the ancient Shraman or ascetic tradition.<BR><BR>Jains have significantly influenced the religious, ethical, political and economic spheres in India for over two millennia. Jainism stresses spiritual independence and equality of all life with particular emphasis on non-violence. Self-control is vital for attaining omniscience (kevala jnana) and eventually moksha, or realization of the soul's true nature.<BR><BR>A Jain is a follower of the Jina, or spiritual victor. Per ancient and contemporary usage, as well as dictionary definitions, a follower of Jain Dharma, or Jainism, is called a Jain. The term Jainist which is found on some internet websites is not used in either literature or common parlance.<BR><BR>Jains have an ancient tradition of scholarship.

For hundreds of years Christians agreed that it was the essential, immortal core of each individual believer, and of the Christian faith in general.

By focusing on the spirits of blood which were alleged to join body and soul, this book explores the peculiar problems, anxieties, and excitement generated by a zone where spirit met matter, and the earthly the divine. It shows how pious but rigorous Christians such as John Donne and Walter Raleigh expressed their dissatisfaction with existing theories of body-soul integration; how prone the soul was to being materialised; and how an increasingly scientific medical culture hunted the material aspects of the soul out of the human body.</p>",Richard Sugg,Christian Books & Bibles,1137345594

Metalevel architectures and re?ection have drawn the attention of researchers and practitioners throughout computer science. Re?ective and metalevel te- niques are being used to address real-world problems in such areas as: progr- ming languages, operating systems, databases, distributed computing, expert systems and web computing. Separation of concerns has been a guiding principle of software engineering for nearly 30 years, but its known bene?ts are seldom fully achieved in practice. This is primarily because traditional mechanisms are not powerful enough to handle many kinds of concerns that occur in practice. Over the last 10 years, to overcome the limitations of traditional frameworks, many researchers, including several from the re?ection community, have proposed new approaches. For the ?rst time, papers on advanced approaches to separation of concerns were explicitly solicited. Following the success of previous conferences such as IMSA’92 in Tokyo, Re?ection’96 in San Francisco, and Re?ection’99 in Saint Malo, we hope that the conference provided an excellent forum for researchers with a broad range of interests in metalevel architectures, re?ective techniques, and separation of concerns in general.",,Computers & Technology,3540426183

Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that process workflows tend to be globally dispersed and thus rely heavily on information technology.

In <b>Lean Six Sigma for the Office</b>, Six Sigma guru James Martin presents proven modifications that can be deployed in offices, particularly those offices involved with global operations. Making use of Kaizen and Six Sigma concepts, along with Lean manufacturing principles, this book instructs managers on how they can improve operational efficiency and increase customer satisfaction. <p>The author brings experience gleaned from his application of these methodologies in a myriad of industries to create a practical and hands-on reference for the office environment. Using a detailed sequence of activities, including over 140 figures and tables as well as checklists and evaluation tools, he demonstrates how to realize the rapid improvement of office operations, and how to eliminate unnecessary tasks through value stream mapping (VSM). <p>The book also emphasizes the importance of strategic alignment of Kaizen events and the impact of organizational culture on process improvement activities. Latter chapters in the book discuss key elements of a change model in the context of transitional improvements as they relate to the process owner and local work team.

Wedged between the East and the West―the Dragon and the Crown―Stanley Kwan’s life experiences are a microcosm of the forces pulling at Hong Kong. He was born into a traditional Chinese banking family but attended King’s College under the British colonial system. Fired up by patriotism during the war, he joined the Nationalist Chinese army and served as an interpreter for American forces in southwest China. In 1949, two of his brothers went to the Mainland to join the socialist revolution. Although tempted to join, he stayed in Hong Kong, worked for a British firm and became a “China watcher” at the American Consulate General. He finally joined a local Chinese bank―Hang Seng Bank where, as head of the Research Department, he launched the Hang Seng Index and witnessed the dramatic ebbs and flows of the Hong Kong economy. With the prospect of 1997, Stanley Kwan deliberated on his future and decided to retire to Canada in 1984, joining the tide of immigrants from Hong Kong. While Hong Kong’s spectacular economic growth and its political development have been well documented, the social and cultural experiences of the ordinary people swept up in the changes and their thoughts and aspirations have not found a significant voice. Through the personal experiences of Stanley Kwan and those around him, the book gives such a voice to people whose lives have been profoundly affected by the dramatic changes that Hong Kong underwent as it transitioned from an entrepôt to an international financial centre and from a colony to become a part of China. The book contributes to the ongoing search for Hong Kong identity in the Special Administrative Region and will resonate among people in Hong Kong and those with ties to or an interest in the fate of the former colony.

With a painstaking, vigorous and engaging Ken Burns meets- Stan Lee approach, the battles and rivalries, the technical innovations, the triumphs and failures are all thoroughly researched and lovingly depicted. plus the charismatic players behind the scenes like Russell Simmons, Sylvia Robinson and then-punker Rick Rubin. Piskor also traces graffiti master Fab 5 Freddyâ€™s rise in the art world, and Debbie Harry, Keith Haring, The Clash, and other luminaries make cameos as the music and culture begin to penetrate downtown Manhattan and the mainstream at large.

Recibe tambien el nombre de mazdeismo (de Ahura Mazda, una de sus deidades). Fue una de las pocas grandes religiones que surgio de la sola predicacion de un profeta. Sus primeros progresos permanecen en la obscuridad. Poco a poco en base a las ensenyanzas de Zoroastro, los magos o casta sacerdotal, organizaron una verdadera religion sistematica en la que mezclaron verenaciones populares, nociones semiticas provenientes de Mesopotamia y narraciones poeticas con que la imaginacion persa envolvio la figura del profeta y los grandes temas que este habia legado a Iran. Esta religion se apoya en los libros mas recientes del Avesta, texto sagrado del Zoroastrismo, y en una abundante literatura en lengua pahlevi. En ella, la figura del reformador cobra su aspecto sobrenatual y fantastico. El primer gran periodo del zoroastrismo como religion estatal se situa bajo la dinastia Aquemenida (559-330 a. C.). La invasion de Persia por Alejandro el Magno, destruyo el estado y la religion perdio su predominio, quedando radicada en algunas regiones lejanas. Segun la tradicion algunos magos (sacerdotes zoroastrinaos) visitaron al ninyo Jesus en Belen. Tras la aparicion del cristianismo en Persia, hubo luchas cruentas, y en 639 la invasion musulmana origino la casi total extincion del zoroastrismo que pudo ser revivido gracias a un grupo de fieles que, huyendo del mahometanismo, emigro a la India y constituyo el origen de los actuales parsis, a traves de los cuales pervive aun la religion pristina.",Zoroastro,Religion & Spirituality,9685566364

321,The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning & Black Study,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UO8EIy1RL.jpg,"In this series of essays, Fred Moten and Stefano Harney draw on the theory and practice of the black radical tradition as it supports, inspires, and extends contemporary social and political thought and aesthetic critique. Today the general wealth of social life finds itself confronted by mutations in the mechanisms of control: the proliferation of capitalist logistics, governance by credit, and the management of pedagogy. Working from and within the social poesis of life in THE UNDERCOMMONS, Moten and Harney develop and expand an array of concepts: study, debt, surround, planning, and the shipped. On the fugitive path of an historical and global blackness, the essays in this volume unsettle and invite the reader to the self-organised ensembles of social life that are launched every day and every night amid the general antagonism of THE UNDERCOMMONS.<br /><br />&#34;This is a powerful book, made of words and sounds, crisscrossed by subversion and love, written and studied 'with and for,' as Stefano Harney and Fred Moten put it. The roar of the battle is never distant while reading THE UNDERCOMMONS. The London riots and occupy, practices of refusal, marronage and flight, slave revolts and anti-colonial uprisings frame a challenging rethinking of concepts such as policy and planning, debt and credit, governance and logistics. THE UNDERCOMMONS is a homage to the black radical tradition, to its generative and constituent power before the task of imagining 'dispossessed feelings in common' as the basis of a renewed communism.&#34; Sandro Mezzadra<br /><br />&#34;What kind of intervention can cut through neoliberal configuration of today's university, which betrays its own liberal commitment to bring about emancipation? THE UNDERCOMMONS is a powerful and necessary intervention that invites us to imagine and realise social life otherwise. In this intimate and intense example of affected writing writing which is always already other, with an other Harney and Moten dare us to fall. Following, feeling, an other possible manner living together, or as one may say with Glissant to be 'born into the world,' which is the fate and gift of blackness. Otherwise living, as in the quilombos created by Brazilian slaves, is the promise that is escape!&#34; Denise Ferreira da Silva",Stefano Harney,Biographies & Memoirs,1570272670

Bringing the people of this land to life in vibrant detail, the author chronicles the rise and fall of power during this period and explores the political and social systems, as well as the technical and cultural innovations, which made this land extraordinary. At the heart of this book is the story of Babylon, which rose to prominence under the Amorite king Hammurabi from about 1800 BCE. Even as Babylon's fortunes waxed and waned, it never lost its allure as the ancient world's greatest city. </p><p>Engaging and compelling, <i>Babylon </i>reveals the splendor of the ancient world that laid the foundation for civilization itself.</p>",Paul Kriwaczek,History,1250054168

This book explores and reflects upon this debate. So far the debate's focus has been on the tension between public protection and individual civil rights, since much of its impetus has derived from notorious homicides in the community and been directed towards calls for a community treatment order. The debate encapsulated here is more comprehensive, going to the heart of the nature of mental illness and its impacts on legal capacity, juxtaposing constructs which arise out of profoundly differing disciplines. The book concludes that the contribution of current mental health legislation is both marginal and it seeks to set an agenda for radical law reform by recognizing that asking questions may, at this stage, be more valuable than providing hasty answers. Many of the chapters deal with the recent Bournewood decision in the House of Lords.",,Law,1901362752

It is this belief in America&rsquo;s honor that allows them to pursue the American Dream even as it remains elusive. . . . They shout, they argue, they wrestle with love, honor, duty, betrayal; they have loud voices and big hearts; they demand justice, they love, they laugh, they cry, they murder, and they embrace life with zest and vigor. . . .

342,Declining Prospects: How Extraordinary Competition and Compensation Are Changing America's Major Law Firms,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oySdxJ3ML.jpg,"“Declining Prospects,” written by a leading expert on law firm economics and operations, describes the dramatic growth and change in many major American law firms in recent years, analyses their prospects for continued profitability and sustainability, and focuses on the vulnerabilities of many important firms manifested most recently by the collapse of Dewey & LeBoeuf. The book explains why and how such growth and change has come about including 1) greatly increased competition for available legal work resulting from the ubiquity of highly capable corporate law departments and a surplus of talented lawyers and law firms, 2) client resistance to the increasing costs of legal services, 3) the commoditization of many legal services and the impact of new technology on the delivery of those services, and 4) the unsettling impact of the profession’s “unlimited free agency” system that enables lawyers with substantial client relationships to move from firm to firm seeking higher compensation. Michael Trotter also comments tellingly on working conditions and the quality of life experienced by lawyers in today’s major law firms. His observations throughout are supported by an abundance of facts and figures relevant to the topics considered. ""Declining Prospects"" will be of great interest to all lawyers, as well as to business executives interested in containing the costs of their legal services and anyone interested in the life of lawyers in the major American law firms or the role of the legal profession in America’s business and economic life. Young people considering law school, and those advising them, will find valuable information concerning their prospects for a satisfying and profitable career as a lawyer. Trotter's earlier book, ""Profit and the Practice of Law—What's Happened to the Legal Profession,"" has emerged as the definitive work on growth and change in the major business practice law firms in America between 1960 and 1995, and has been widely praised by prominent lawyers, bar association leaders, law firm consultants and legal scholars.",Michael H.

John Curtis Holmes was just a simple country boy from Ohio when he moved to California in 1964. It was the infancy of hardcore, so in Holmes' wildest dreams, he could not have predicted the turbulent ride on which he had embarked by publicizing his private parts. With the fame he achieved by playing his most famous character - a gun toting detective named Johnny Wadd - came money. Holmes was pleased to spend it on his wife and mistresses, but soon was in over his head after he became addicted to cocaine. Unfortunately for Holmes, in the years that followed, his addiction led him into several desperate choices - including setting up a robbery at the home of Ed Nash, a powerful L.A. nightclub owner. The robbery resulted in one of the most gruesome, unsolved, multiple-murders in Hollywood history. Amazingly, before his untimely death in 1988, Holmes regained his momentum, remarried and rebuilt his life and career. However, the grave consequences of his addiction, his association with the Wonderland murders, and his AIDS-related death made him an infamous figure in pop culture. Digging past the stigmas, John Holmes: A Life Measured in Inches - the first biography about John C. Holmes - unearths the human being behind the penis and proves that there was more to him than could be measured in inches.

The reader will discover that the language of the world's oldest fraternal society has also made its own interesting journey, and been tested by the most powerful and the most humbling of men. The result is, that, in Masonic lodges across America, and, indeed, the world, men from every walk of life, of all ages, every social category and every spiritual and philosophical conviction are able to find a basis for reflection on who they are, why they are here, and what has meaning to them. By its common language delivered in a common culture of fraternal relationship, Freemasonry is enabled to exemplify a univeral brotherhood of man.

An architect in Chile has designed a form of social housing where only half of the house is built, allowing the owners to adapt the rest; Medell&iacute;n, formerly the world&rsquo;s murder capital, has been transformed with innovative public architecture; squatters in Caracas have taken over the forty-five-story Torre David skyscraper; and Rio is on a mission to incorporate its favelas into the rest of the city. <br><br>Here, in the most urbanised continent on the planet, extreme cities have bred extreme conditions, from vast housing estates to sprawling slums. But after decades of social and political failure, a new generation has revitalised architecture and urban design in order to address persistent poverty and inequality. Together, these activists, pragmatists and social idealists are performing bold experiments that the rest of the world may learn from.<br><br><i>Radical Cities</i> is a colorful journey through Latin America&mdash;a crucible of architectural and urban innovation.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",Justin McGuirk,Politics & Social Sciences,1781688680

434,Germany: Memories of a Nation,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dZvcqmjWL.jpg,"<p>For the past 140 years, Germany has been the central power in continental europe. Twenty-five years ago a new German state came into being. How much do we really understand this new Germany, and how do its people understand themselves?<br><br>Neil MacGregor argues that, uniquely for any European country, no coherent, overarching narrative of Germany's history can be constructed, for in Germany both geography and history have always been unstable. Its frontiers have constantly shifted. K&ouml;nigsberg, home to the greatest German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, is now Kaliningrad, Russia; Strasbourg, in whose cathedral Wolfgang von Geothe, Germany's greatest writer, discovered the distinctiveness of his country's art and history, now lies within the borders of France. For most of the five hundred years covered by this book Germany has been composed of many separate political units, each with a distinct history. And any comfortable national story Germans might have told themselves before 1914 was destroyed by the events of the following thirty years.<br><br>German history may be inherently fragmented, but it contains a large number of widely shared memories, awarenesses, and experiences; examining some of these is the purpose of this book. MacGregor chooses objects and ideas, people and places that still resonate in the new Germany&mdash;porcelain from Dresden and rubble from its ruins, Bauhaus design and the German sausage, the crown of Charlemagne and the gates of Buchenwald&mdash;to show us something of its collective imagination. There has never been a book about Germany quite like it.</p>",Neil MacGregor,History,1101875666

Most had never left home, never experienced a different culture. None had any guarantee of success. That they achieved so much for themselves and their country profoundly altered American history. As David McCullough writes, &#8220;Not all pioneers went west.&#8221; Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in America, was one of this intrepid band. Another was Charles Sumner, who enrolled at the Sorbonne because of a burning desire to know more about everything. There he saw black students with the same ambition he had, and when he returned home, he would become the most powerful, unyielding voice for abolition in the U.S. Senate, almost at the cost of his life. <P>Two staunch friends, James Fenimore Cooper and Samuel F. B. Morse, worked unrelentingly every day in Paris, Cooper writing and Morse painting what would be his masterpiece. From something he saw in France, Morse would also bring home his momentous idea for the telegraph. <P>Pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk from New Orleans launched his spectacular career performing in Paris at age 15. George P. A. Healy, who had almost no money and little education, took the gamble of a lifetime and with no prospects whatsoever in Paris became one of the most celebrated portrait painters of the day. His subjects included Abraham Lincoln. <P>Medical student Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote home of his toil and the exhilaration in &#8220;being at the center of things&#8221; in what was then the medical capital of the world. From all they learned in Paris, Holmes and his fellow &#8220;medicals&#8221; were to exert lasting influence on the profession of medicine in the United States. <P>Writers Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and Henry James were all &#8220;discovering&#8221; Paris, marveling at the treasures in the Louvre, or out with the Sunday throngs strolling the city&#8217;s boulevards and gardens. &#8220;At last I have come into a dreamland,&#8221; wrote Harriet Beecher Stowe, seeking escape from the notoriety <I>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin </I>had brought her. Almost forgotten today, the heroic American ambassador Elihu Washburne bravely remained at his post through the Franco-Prussian War, the long Siege of Paris and even more atrocious nightmare of the Commune. His vivid account in his diary of the starvation and suffering endured by the people of Paris (drawn on here for the first time) is one readers will never forget. The genius of sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the son of an immigrant shoemaker, and of painters Mary Cassatt and John Singer Sargent, three of the greatest American artists ever, would flourish in Paris, inspired by the examples of brilliant French masters, and by Paris itself. <P>Nearly all of these Americans, whatever their troubles learning French, their spells of homesickness, and their suffering in the raw cold winters by the Seine, spent many of the happiest days and nights of their lives in Paris. McCullough tells this sweeping, fascinating story with power and intimacy, bringing us into the lives of remarkable men and women who, in Saint-Gaudens&#8217;s phrase, longed &#8220;to soar into the blue.&#8221; <I>The Greater Journey </I>is itself a masterpiece.",David McCullough,History,1416571760

The white minority government had become an international outcast in refusing to give in to the inevitability of black majority rule. Finally the defiant white prime minister Ian Smith was forced to step down and Mugabe was elected president. Initially he promised reconciliation between white and blacks, encouraged Zimbabwe's economic and social development, and was admired throughout the world as one of the leaders of the emerging nations and as a model for a transition from colonial leadership. But as Martin Meredith shows in this history of Mugabe's rule, Mugabe from the beginning was sacrificing his purported ideals&#151;and Zimbabwe's potential&#151;to the goal of extending and cementing his autocratic leadership. Over time, Mugabe has become ever more dictatorial, and seemingly less and less interested in the welfare of his people, treating Zimbabwe's wealth and resources as spoils of war for his inner circle. In recent years he has unleashed a reign of terror and corruption in his country. Like the Congo, Angola, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Liberia, Zimbabwe has been on a steady slide to disaster. Now for the first time the whole story is told in detail by an expert. It is a riveting and tragic political story, a morality tale, and an essential text for understanding today's Africa.",Martin Meredith,History,158648558X
458,Water Margin: Hong Kong's Link to the Sea,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519WHsKcL7L.jpg,"<i>Water Margin: Hong Kong's Link to the Sea</i> is an enchanting exploration of the human and natural geography of Hong Kong's coastline and waters. The volume opens with Hong Kong's early history as a wild coastal frontier (<i>haijiang</i>) of imperial China and follows the social and cultural development of its maritime border zone. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Chinese and Western influences created the city of Hong Kong, a durable crossroads forever reinventing itself. Today, Hong Kong's coastline boasts an intense mix of urban high-rise dwellings, vast shipping facilities, and near-pristine wild areas. It is home to one of the most vibrant water sports venues in Asia and hosts a range of unique wildlife populations, including dolphins, turtles, and migratory birds. This volume focuses on Hong Kong's coral and marine diversity, containing a breathtaking array of underwater photographs. The text is filled with little-known tales of pearl fishing, crocodile boating, piracy, the adventures of the city's fishing fleet, and the voices of Hong Kong's ocean heros, including Olympic gold medalist Lee Lai Shan, singer G.E.M., and the elders of Hong Kong's remote fishing villages. A portfolio of Robin Moyer's black and white photography recaptures Hong Kong's seascapes and its unceasing resources of wonder for local residents and tourists alike. The volume also covers global ocean protection initiatives sponsored by the Ocean Recovery Alliance. In addition to raising awareness and an appreciation for these precious waters, the text examines the key challenge of reviving and preserving Hong Kong's aquatic environment for future generations.",Matthew Flynn,History,9881566576

Its unique relationship with the United States evolved through a series of friendships between Bahrain's ruling Al Khalifa royal family and top U.S. Navy flag officers assigned to the fleet in the Gulf. Over the years it has become a strategic partnership critical to global security. As naval historian David F. Winkler examines these developing relationships, he offers a fascinating overview of Bahraini history, the entry of American humanitarian and economic interests, the establishment of an American naval presence in the Cold War, the Arab-Israeli conflicts, and the downfall of the Iranian shah, among other subjects. The author tells the story from both Bahraini and American perspectives. Given U.S. commitment to the region and its concurrent objectives of combating the global war on terrorism and establishing democracy, this book provides an important historical context for those interested in a crucial facet of American foreign relations.

The author and his companions travel from the Cascades of the Pacific Northwest to the deserts of the American Southwest to journey rivers both famous (Salmon) and obscure (South Fork of the Owyhee).</p> <p align=""left"">Along the way they encounter rain and snow, thunderstorms and sandstorms, flash floods, and even earthquakes.

There are many men and women who have made expeditions down exotic rivers which I can only dream of. Yet I believe that is what makes our trips noteworthy, in that common people can still enjoy extraordinary experiences. The individuals that you will read about in this book come from many walks of life. Collectively, our crews consisted of (among others) auto mechanics, nurses, sheet metal workers, civil servants, X-ray techs, teachers, small business owners, a medical student, an orthodontist and a pastor. Despite these differences in occupations, as well as level of experience in the outdoors, I believe that (for the most part) we worked quite well together as a team.

It painted a realistic and exciting view of the challenges that early Mars settlers will face. In the tradition of Red Mars, it made our future on Mars feel 100% real.” “There is non-stop action start to finish with excellent attention to details that affords the reader with a real understanding of what exploring mars may be like and what challenges it would present.” “As I read this book the imagery jumps at me, and it is like I am in the pmozer with the characters.” Any landing within the north polar cap of Mars carried risk, but the pay was soooo good. Nobody else would take the job, no matter what it paid. Only one remotely controlled exploration hopper came back from the cold, crusty region, but the samples it returned were unlike anything seen before. Someone had to go; life had once existed there.

This book shows them how. Written by a supervising psychologist who specializes in child behavioral issues, <strong>Parenting Your Child with ADHD</strong> presents a groundbreaking program for parents seeking to reduce their child’s inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity and strengthen his or her capacity for self-reliance and cooperation. This unique program promotes positive ways of interrelating and shows parents the five main ways they may have unwittingly reinforced ADHD symptoms in the past. Far from encouraging parents to strictly manage ADHD children, this approach promotes independence in kids so that less discipline and surveillance is necessary.</p> <p> Specifically, this book helps parents promote cooperation by phrasing their requests in specific ways, reduce pressure on their child, and acknowledge the child’s preference as a way to make cooperation a more attractive choice to him or her. Parents learn to resolve problems related to messiness, inappropriate silliness and intrusiveness, chores and helping family members, coordinating schedules, sneaking and stealing, noise and yelling, and overreacting. The second part of the book moves on to issues that take place outside the home, such as shopping excursions, family outings, and travel. Finally, parents learn ways to increase their child’s independence and cooperation with schoolwork and compliance in the classroom environment. The child learns the value of being knowledgeable without the motivation of punishment or gift rewards.</p> ",Craig Wiener EdD,Parenting & Relationships,1608823962

Rooted in Lewis' personal story, it also reflects on the highs and lows of the broader civil rights movement. <br /><br />Book One spans John Lewis' youth in rural Alabama, his life-changing meeting with Martin Luther King, Jr., the birth of the Nashville Student Movement, and their battle to tear down segregation through nonviolent lunch counter sit-ins, building to a stunning climax on the steps of City Hall. <br /><br />Many years ago, John Lewis and other student activists drew inspiration from the 1958 comic book ""Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story.""

Thousands of civilians, many of them young women from small towns across the U.S., were recruited to this secret city, enticed by the promise of solid wages and war-ending work. What were they actually <I>doing</I> there? Very few knew. The purpose of this mysterious government project was kept a secret from the outside world and from the majority of the residents themselves. Some wondered why, despite the constant work and round-the-clock activity in this makeshift town, did no tangible product of any kind ever seem to leave its guarded gates? The women who kept this town running would find out at the end of the war, when Oak Ridge&#8217;s secret was revealed and changed the world forever.<BR><BR>Drawing from the voices and experiences of the women who lived and worked in Oak Ridge, <I>The Girls of Atomic City</I> rescues a remarkable, forgotten chapter of World War II from obscurity.

536,"Living in Squares, Loving in Triangles: The Lives and Loves of Virginia Woolf & the Bloomsbury Group",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xHzuimhEL.jpg,"The lives of the sisters Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf have long been celebrated for their central roles in the development of modernism in art and literature. Inspired by European Post-Impressionism, Vanessa’s experimental work places her at the vanguard of early twentieth-century art, as does her role in helping introduce many key names – Cézanne, Matisse, Picasso – to an unsuspecting public in 1910. Virginia took these artistic innovations and applied them to literature, pushing the boundaries of form, narrative and language to find a voice uniquely her own. Yet their private lives were just as experimental. Forming the core of the Bloomsbury Group, they welcomed into their London and Sussex homes a host of their talented peers and followed their hearts in the pursuit of love.Vanessa’s marriage to art critic Clive Bell was shaken early on by his flirtation with her sister, but this allowed her to find happiness with fellow artist Roger Fry. It was the predominantly homosexual Duncan Grant, though, who would become her lifelong partner, as they shared and decorated their home, Charleston, making it a living showpiece for their art. Virginia’s marriage to Leonard Woolf placed him more in the role of carer than husband, with the pair abstaining from sex and living under a regime designed to meet the needs of Virginia’s fragile mental health. Her meeting with the aristocratic Vita Sackville-West and their lesbian affair led Virginia to write one of the masterpieces of modern literature. What led the sisters to make such choices? How did they reconcile life and art? How did it feel, in early modern Britain, to live outside the social box? The sisters lived bravely, passionately and innovatively; where did this strength and talent come from?",Amy Licence,Biographies & Memoirs,1445645750

The book identifies key moments in this relationship, from the person's initial reaction to the chaplain, to the chaplain becoming an accompanying presence and creating the potential to provide comfort, strength and ""hope in the present"".</p><p>This thoughtful and inquisitive book investigates the underlying theory that spiritual care is rooted in relationship.
