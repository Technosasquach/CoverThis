2,"A Partner in Holiness: Deepening Mindfulness, Practicing Compassion and Enriching Our Lives Through the Wisdom of R. Levi Yitzhak of Berdichev's, Vol. 2  (Institute for Jewish Spirituality)",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pum0eWe4L.jpg,"<p><strong>Find inspiration for a satisfying spiritual life of practice through the combination of contemporary mindfulness meditation and classical Hasidic spirituality.</strong></p><blockquote><p>""The lessons in <em>Kedushat Levi</em> were not originally intended as intellectual curiosities or as demonstrations of R. Levi Yitzhak's brilliance. They were meant to inspire religious passion and deeper spiritual practice. I believe that these teachings will come to life in us when we bring them into our lives in practice.""</p><p>―from the Introduction</p></blockquote><p>The soul yearns to feel connected to something greater and to know happiness despite personal suffering and seemingly endless need. Surprisingly, the perspectives of the late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Hasidic spiritual teachers offer a radically different Jewish theology that speaks directly to today's spiritual seekers whose faith has been shattered by both modernity and the Holocaust. These masters taught of interdependence, interconnectedness, selflessness, service and joy, anticipating the insights of contemporary science and twenty-first-century spirituality.</p><p>Bringing together the teachings of beloved Hasidic master Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berdichev (1740–1809) and the practice of mindfulness meditation, Rabbi Jonathan P. Slater reveals a new entrance into Jewish spiritual life. Covering the Five Books of Moses, these two volumes present accessible translations of selections from <em>Kedushat Levi</em>, R. Levi Yitzhak's Hasidic Torah commentary, which emphasizes our spiritual capacity to transform consciousness and so our life experience. The selections are paired with Rabbi Slater's commentaries to illuminate their message.</p>",Rabbi Jonathan P. Slater DMin,Religion & Spirituality
