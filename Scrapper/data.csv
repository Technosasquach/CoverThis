Levi Yitzhak's brilliance. They were meant to inspire religious passion and deeper spiritual practice. I believe that these teachings will come to life in us when we bring them into our lives in practice.""</p><p>―from the Introduction</p></blockquote><p>The soul yearns to feel connected to something greater and to know happiness despite personal suffering and seemingly endless need. Surprisingly, the perspectives of the late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Hasidic spiritual teachers offer a radically different Jewish theology that speaks directly to today's spiritual seekers whose faith has been shattered by both modernity and the Holocaust. These masters taught of interdependence, interconnectedness, selflessness, service and joy, anticipating the insights of contemporary science and twenty-first-century spirituality.</p><p>Bringing together the teachings of beloved Hasidic master Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berdichev (1740–1809) and the practice of mindfulness meditation, Rabbi Jonathan P. Slater reveals a new entrance into Jewish spiritual life. Covering the Five Books of Moses, these two volumes present accessible translations of selections from <em>Kedushat Levi</em>, R. Levi Yitzhak's Hasidic Torah commentary, which emphasizes our spiritual capacity to transform consciousness and so our life experience. The selections are paired with Rabbi Slater's commentaries to illuminate their message.</p>",Rabbi Jonathan P. Slater DMin,Religion & Spirituality,1580237959

The Beljanski method fights disease by targeting damaged or destabilized DNA in the body, allowing cells with healthy DNA to thrive. Beljanski, with his wife Monique, went on to develop natural compounds that enhance the body&#8217;s resistance not only to degenerative diseases but also to the effects of environmental toxicity and the ravages of aging. Beljanski&#8217;s compounds are now being studied at Columbia University, and other centers, where early findings support his theories.<br /><br />In this book, the authors build on Mirko Beljanski&#8217;s work to demonstrate how physiological and environmental factors both weaken the body&#8217;s immune system and alter DNA functioning. They explain how aging exacerbates these effects, leading to cancer and other diseases. The authors then present the innovative compounds Beljanski developed and how they are able to prevent dysfunctional cells from multiplying. They also detail how to integrate essential nutritional strategies for maximizing health and fighting aging at the cellular level.",Hervé Janecek Ph.D.,"Health, Fitness & Dieting",1594772592
