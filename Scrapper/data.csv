THIS IS NOT A METAPHOR. </p><p> You will dismiss this as ridiculous fear-mongering. Dismissing things as ridiculous fear-mongering is, in fact, the first symptom of parasitic spider infection -- the creature stimulates skepticism, in order to prevent you from seeking a cure. That's just as well, since the ""cure"" involves learning what a chainsaw tastes like. You can't feel the spider, because it controls your nerve endings. You won't even feel it when it breeds. And it will breed. </p><p> Just stay calm, and remember that telling you about the spider situation is <i>not</i> the same as having caused it. I'm just the messenger. Even if I did sort of cause it. Either way, I won't hold it against you if you're upset. I know that's just the spider talking.</p><p>""Like an episode of AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" written by Douglas Adams of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" …Imagine a mentally ill narrator describing the zombie apocalypse while drunk, and the end result is unlike any other book of the genre.

The Beljanski method fights disease by targeting damaged or destabilized DNA in the body, allowing cells with healthy DNA to thrive. Beljanski, with his wife Monique, went on to develop natural compounds that enhance the body&#8217;s resistance not only to degenerative diseases but also to the effects of environmental toxicity and the ravages of aging. Beljanski&#8217;s compounds are now being studied at Columbia University, and other centers, where early findings support his theories.<br /><br />In this book, the authors build on Mirko Beljanski&#8217;s work to demonstrate how physiological and environmental factors both weaken the body&#8217;s immune system and alter DNA functioning. They explain how aging exacerbates these effects, leading to cancer and other diseases. The authors then present the innovative compounds Beljanski developed and how they are able to prevent dysfunctional cells from multiplying. They also detail how to integrate essential nutritional strategies for maximizing health and fighting aging at the cellular level.",Hervé Janecek Ph.D.,"Health, Fitness & Dieting",1594772592
