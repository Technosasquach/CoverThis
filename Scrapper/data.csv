2,"A Partner in Holiness: Deepening Mindfulness, Practicing Compassion and Enriching Our Lives Through the Wisdom of R. Levi Yitzhak of Berdichev's, Vol. 2  (Institute for Jewish Spirituality)",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pum0eWe4L.jpg,"<p>Volume 2 of a 2-volume set</p><p>The soul yearns to feel connected to something greater and to know happiness despite personal suffering and seemingly endless need. Surprisingly, the teachings of nineteenth-century Hasidic spiritual teachers offer a radically different Jewish theology that speaks directly to contemporary spiritual seekers whose faith has been shattered by both modernity and the Holocaust. These masters taught of interdependence, interconnectedness, selflessness, service and joy, anticipating the insights of contemporary science and twenty-first-century spirituality.</p><p>Mindfulness meditation, growing in popularity and influence throughout North America, directs practitioners to focus on their life experience in each moment. The spiritual practice offers the possibility of inner peace, fearlessness and expansive concern for the wellbeing of others.</p><p>These volumes bring the two together, providing a practical mindfulness method for applying the spiritual teachings of the Hasidic masters to everyday spiritual life. Covering the Five Books of Moses, they present accessible translations (many previously unavailable in English) of selections from <em>Kedushat Levi</em>, the Hasidic Torah commentary of Rabbi Levi Yitzhak of Berdichev, one of the most beloved Hasidic leaders. His Torah commentary emphasizes our spiritual capacity to transform consciousness and so our life experience. The selections are paired with Rabbi Jonathan Slater's commentaries to help the reader understand their message and suggestions for practice, based in mindfulness, grounding them in a contemporary life.</p>"
