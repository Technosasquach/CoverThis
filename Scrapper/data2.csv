It is full of human insights, and it has a deep understanding of successful leadership, an appreciation of selflessness as the key to our collective future, an awareness of history's relevance to our lives and an unflinching emphasis on excellence. Siong Guan Lim is one of the most outstanding public servants in any country, and after finishing this book, you will know why.""<BR>Senator Bill Bradley<BR>Former U.S. Senator and a Managing Director at Allen & Co.<BR>United States of America<BR><BR>""The Leader, the Teacher and You is a riveting and thoughtful study on leadership based on theory, principles, and experience by a former Head of the Civil Service and one of Singapore's most successful and admired public servants, Siong Guan Lim. It should be read by every student of politics and public policy, and anyone who aspires to play a leadership role. The book, which as the author says is ""part biography, part commentary, and part exposition"", is loaded with insights into how to work with people, deal with reality, motivate an organisation, achieve results, anticipate change, and ensure relevance of the organisation. For those who have long puzzled over how Singapore has been able to achieve so much with so little and in short time, it is public servants such as Siong Guan Lim who have made the partnership between the civil service and the elected politicians so fruitful. Through his fascinating account of how he started in his first job as an engineer in the Sewerage Department, went on to be the Principal Private Secretary to Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, worked with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Dr Goh Keng Swee, and became successively Permanent Secretary of Defence, Education, and Finance, he recounts the crucial mentorship and inspiration provided by Singapore's leaders. He thoroughly examines what true leadership is all about. Lim moved on to become Chairman of Singapore's Economic Development Board and then Group President of GIC Private Limited, the wealth fund of Singapore. I have not read such a clear analysis of the function of leadership written so succinctly and in such practical terms.

It sets out a framework for leaders based on values and culture, but also on lessons learned by having to take tough decisions. Siong Guan Lim had an outstanding career in the development of Singapore. The ability, motivation, and vision of the author and his colleagues are clearly one reason why Singapore and Lee Kuan Yew were so successful.

Substantial progress has been made by researchers in various disciplines, particularly over the last fifteen years, towards realizing the potential of this tissue to yield powerful experimental models for morphogenesis and tissue development; for cellular differentiation; for the biosynthesis and secretion of proteins, lipids, small molecules and inorganic salts; and for the coordination and regulation of these processes. More recently, the possibility of exploiting the secretory epithelial cells of mammary tissue as `cell factories' has become a reality and the recombinant production by lactating animals of an increasing number of proteins, valuable both in the pharmaceutical and `nutraceutical' fields, is in progress or under development. <br/> Also in this sphere of agricultural production, genetic as well as nutritional technologies are under investigation and exploitation to optimize milk composition for various end-uses - for instance in food process and manufacture. The possibilities of deriving health benefit from the bioactive properties of some of the minor constituents of milk are emerging to counter the highly-publicized negative health impact of excessive consumption of saturated animal fats. In human nutrition and medicine, the mammary gland is both a source of nutrition to the neonate and a potential health threat to the adult female - breast cancer remains the major single cause of female mortality in most developed countries. <br/> This volume provides a unique glimpse into our understanding, at the cutting edge of a variety of disciplines, of this versatile and extraordinary tissue, at the birth of the twenty-first century.",,Medical Books,1475786433

To change something, build a new model that makes the old model obsolete.” This book provides just that model, as well as concrete practices for living it. The model is derived from ancient wisdom traditions, modeled on the pulses, cycles, and seasons of our beloved Earth Mother. It deeply grounds the reader in a “this world” spirituality that blends indigenous cosmologies, earth-honoring ritual, and time-tested models for living with modern sensibilities.</p> <p>The proposed text presents the biography of an extraordinary man, who has awakened to his own purpose in life as a servant to conscious evolution for all humanity. His life story, full of adventure, cosmic “interventions,” and synchronicity is on par with that of the luminaries documented in these biographies and the time has come for his story to be told. don Oscar’s story is also the story of each one of us. The only reason his story has not been told until now is that he was first charged with creating opportunities for others to awaken to their higher purpose through his teachings as part of an oral tradition. Now, after completing his “compacto” (sacred contract) with his Andean teachers and mentors, he has been released from service to tell his story in writing. And it is an extraordinary story, dealing with nothing less than individual, spiritual, and planetary transformation.</p>",Oscar Miro-Quesada,Religion & Spirituality,193790718X

Illuminated by boldly conceived and artfully rendered maps and infographics, nineteen essays by LA's most exciting writers reveal complex histories and perspectives of a place notorious for superficiality. This chorus of voices explores wildly different subjects: Cindi Alvitre unveils the indigenous Tongva presence of the Los Angeles Basin; Michael Jaime-Becerra takes us into the smoky, spicy kitchens of a family taquero business in El Monte; Steve Graves traces the cowboy-and-spacemen-themed landscapes of the San Fernando Valley. Overlooked sites and phenomena become apparent: LGBT churches and synagogues, a fabled &ldquo;Cycleway,&rdquo; mustachioed golden carp, urban forests, lost buildings, ugly buildings. What has been ignored, such as environmental and social injustice, is addressed with powerful anger and elegiac sadness, and what has been maligned is reexamined with a sense of pride: the city's freeways, for example, take the shape of a dove when viewed from midair and pulsate with wailing blues, surf rock, and brassy banda. Inspired by other texts that combine literature and landscape, including Rebecca Solnit's <i>Infinite City</i>, this book's juxtapositions make surprising connections and stir up undercurrents of truth.

Yet its martial confidence contrasted vividly with its sense of cultural inferiority. Still looking to a defeated and dispirited Europe for intellectual and artistic guidance, the burgeoning transnational elite in New York and Washington embraced not only the war&#8217;s refugees, but many of their ideas as well, and nothing has proven more pernicious than those of the Frankfurt School and its reactionary philosophy of &#147;critical theory.&#8221;<br><BR>In <I>The Devil's Pleasure Palace</I>, Michael Walsh describes how Critical Theory released a horde of demons into the American psyche. When everything could be questioned, nothing could be real, and the muscular, confident empiricism that had just won the war gave way, in less than a generation, to a central-European nihilism celebrated on college campuses across the United States. Seizing the high ground of academe and the arts, the New Nihilists set about dissolving the bedrock of the country, from patriotism to marriage to the family to military service. They have sown, as Cardinal Bergoglio&#151;now Pope Francis&#151;once wrote of the Devil, &#147;destruction, division, hatred, and calumny,&#8221; and all disguised as the search for truth.<BR><BR><I>The Devil's Pleasure Palace</I> exposes the overlooked movement that is Critical Theory and explains how it took root in America and, once established and gestated, how it has affected nearly every aspect of American life and society.<BR>",Michael Walsh,Humor & Entertainment,159403768X

No matter what you do, it isn’t quite good enough. When you speak up, mom says, “Well then, I guess I’m just a horrible mother.” The mixed messages and guilt weighs you down and leaves you wondering if you can ever get it right. How can you turn this around, free yourself from self-doubt, and break the cycle for your own daughter? You can meditate, chant affirmations, and dutifully practice feeling grateful all you want, but you can’t create the life you desire without addressing the issues around the person who first gave you life. Do you apologize chronically, saying, “I’m sorry” and “it’s ok”, when it isn’t? Second-guess yourself with every decision? Look to others for your sense of self worth? Feel that you have to choose between looking good and feeling good? Come with me, as I show you how the problems you have with your mother mirror the problems you have in life. By understanding what has gone wrong in the mother/daughter relationship and turning it around, you activate the Feminine energy that is the key to having the life you’ve always wanted. Are you ready to rise up, come alive, and live beyond your mother’s limiting messages? Rise up and claim your full true Feminine power! In psychotherapist’s Katherine Fabrizio’s ground breaking book, DAUGHTERS RISING, she tells you how your relationship with your mother is affecting your life in ways you have not yet imagined. Your struggle with mom mirrors the internal struggle you have with yourself. The impossible standards your mother tried to live up to has caused you to be filled with shame, guilt and self-doubt. It doesn’t have to be this way. Buried in each disempowering message is a message of strength and hope when you get back online with your Feminine power. You can’t get there with the masculine energy that held your mother down and is so prevalent in the western culture today. This book will break the spells that are holding you back from the life you’ve always wanted and show you the way home to claim your true Feminine power. Get clear on the mixed messages that were passed down to you and learn how to rise above those messages. What are you waiting for? Your life is waiting. See how you have had the power in you all along. This, my pretty, changes everything.",Katherine K Fabrizio,Parenting & Relationships,1507799144

136,Christopher Anderson: Capitolio,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31jwMtiPISL.jpg,"<I>Capitolio</I> is New York documentary photographer Christopher Anderson's cinematic journey through the upheavals of contemporary Caracas, Venezuela, in the tradition of such earlier projects as William Klein's <I>New York</I> (1954-55) and Robert Frank's <I>The Americans</I> (1958). It presents a poetic and politicized vision, by one of today's finest documentary photographers, of a city and a country that is ripping apart at the seams under the stress of popular unrest, and whose turmoil remains largely unreported by Western media. No stranger to such fraught situations (he covered the 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel from its inception), Anderson notates the country's current incongruities, where the violent and the sensual intermingle chaotically. ""The word 'capitolio' refers to the domed building that houses a government,"" writes Anderson, elaborating on the title of this volume; ""here, the city of Caracas, Venezuela, is itself a metaphorical capitolio building. The decaying Modernist architecture, with a jungle growing through the cracks, becomes the walls of this building and the violent streets become the corridors where the human drama plays itself out in what President Hugo Chavez called a 'revolution.'""",,Travel,8492480572
