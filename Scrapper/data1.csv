0,John Martin Littlejohn: An Enigma of Osteopathy,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Lpg7xmrBL.jpg,"J Martin Littlejohn was a person who stood literally and figuratively shoulder to shoulder with the founder of osteopathy, A T Still. A proud presbyterian Scot who made his career and reputation in the USA, only to have it questioned and discredited after returning to pursue his osteopathic practice in London, Littlejohn was a controversial character. Undoubtedly a pioneer in establishing osteopathic medicine both in the USA and in the UK, he was also a fraud, using contentious qualifications to promote his academic and scientific credibility. No one has been able to write a comprehensive study of Littlejohn until now. John O'Brien has spent years researching the man. Using the objective eye of a professional historian, he has visited the institutions of Littlejohn's life and career, in Northern Ireland, Chicago, Illinois and Kirksville, Missouri, and the National Osteopathic Archive in London, as well as holding interviews with Littlejohn's family in the UK. He was granted access to previously unseen historic material as well as personal family mementos and photographs. This book will be read by anyone with an interest in the history of osteopathy. It gives a thorough description of the life and work of J Martin Littlejohn, with a broad analysis of how and why he took the major decisions to affect his career, for good or bad. And of course the consequences of those decisions, which had a major influence on the development of osteopathy in the 20th century. Key points: 30 photographs, some previously unseen Author access to previously unseen archives Contributions from Littlejohn's family",John O'Brien,Medical Books,1848291388

Lon Chaney Jr., who was the only actor to portray Universal's four classic monster roles; Dracula, frankenstein's monster, the mummy and the wolfman. At first Chaney was to play both roles, as his father Lon Chaney Sr. had done in several of his famous silent films. But Larry Talbot in his human phase would look exactly like Count Dracula so the role of Dracula was given to it's originator Bela Lugosi. A script was prepared by Bernard Shubert, who had written the screenplay for Tod Browning's London After Midnight(MGM 1927) remake Mark of the Vampire (MGM 1935). Shubert kept the settings very tight in its scenes, to keep the cost down to balance out for the extra expense of technicolor. But by 1944 Bela Lugosi was in his 60s and would have had to play part of his role as a giant bat much like in the Copolla Bram Stoker's Dracula in the 90s - and that would have been too much for him. And they couldn't have the Wolfman fighting an animated bat much like John Carradine's depiction of the Count or even Lugosi's portrayal in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. So they decided to make one of their Arabian Nights film on the Technicolor contract and all that remained of Wolfman vs Dracula are some color 8x10s of Chaney in both parts. This volume has a short biography of screenwriter/TV producer Bernard Shubert and comments from Shubert and special effects cinematographer David Stanley Horsley.",Philip J.

The Collapse of Complex Societies, though written by an archaeologist, will therefore strike a chord throughout the social sciences.

36,Sitting in a Rowboat Throwing Marbles at a Battleship,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yNdTLRyAL.jpg,"An epidemic of addiction to pornography and compulsive sexual behavior is wiping out individuals, marriages and families! It has become clear that Latter-day Saints are not immune. Men, women and children of the LDS faith are finding, as Elder Neal A. Maxwell observed, that the chains of pornography do not easily let go of their victims. Fear, shame and humiliation prevent so many addicts from getting the help they need. Instead, they keep praying and reading their scriptures and hoping that Heavenly Father will just make this whole thing go away. In the meantime, years pass and the problem grows worse, not better. Despair is abundant; hope is scarce.<P> &#34;But this isn't how it has to be!&#34; exclaims Andrew Pipanne, a Latter-day Saint and recovering sex and pornography addict. &#34;Recovery from addiction is not only possible, but it's also a wonderful experience!&#34; <i>Sitting in a Rowboat Throwing Marbles at a Battleship</i> is a collection of essays written by Andrew to help other LDS addicts, spouses, counselors and priesthood leaders understand exactly what is necessary for that recovery experience to take place.<P> Drawing on events from his own life, Andrew explains with rare insight how he and many other Mormons finally figured out what was keeping them from overcoming their &#34;little porn problem.&#34; He presents a simple way of understanding what we're really dealing with in the now classic essay &#34;The ABCs of Pornography Addiction.&#34; In &#34;The Silent Seventy Percent,&#34; Andrew discusses why secrecy and isolation are suffocating so many Mormons as they desperately try to overcome their addiction on their own.<P> &#34;A Letter to LDS Wives About Pornography Addiction&#34; has also become a classic essay, helping thousands of Mormon women come to understand and accept that they didn't cause this problem in their husbands, they can't control it and they can't cure it. Through this book and the related LDS-focused recovery website, RowboatAndMarbles.org, these women are finding not only a greater understanding of the problem of pornography addiction, but they are also becoming empowered with the knowledge that they don't have to live with it and the insanity it causes in their families.<P> <i>Sitting in a Rowboat...</i> is full of hope but it is also full of reality, so it contains a lot of ideas that may be difficult for some Latter-day Saints (and others) to hear. &#34;Addiction distorts our view of reality,&#34; explains Andrew. &#34;Addiction causes us to twist and manipulate basic Gospel truths so that we eventually come to believe--falsely--that we really are following the Savior and that our compulsive sexual behavior including porn consumption is nothing more than a tiny bump in the road--no big deal.&#34; As one reader put it, &#34;<i>Sitting in a Rowboat...</i> takes away the wiggle room that keeps so many Mormons in denial about their addiction and prevents them from getting the help they need.&#34;<P> In some of the most touching essays in the book, Andrew explains what recovery from addiction actually feels like and how that recovery changes the way we think, act and feel. &#34;For years,&#34; says Andrew, &#34;I kept telling myself that I was done with the porn--for real this time--only to fall back into it days, weeks or months later. It wasn't until I started working an honest recovery program with a sponsor, with other recovering addicts and with an effective 12 Step program that I finally starting feeling a genuine change in my heart and mind. I finally knew why I no longer acted out with my drug and I knew that I now had the tools I needed never to act out again!&#34;<P> The message that Andrew shouts from the rooftops is that recovery from porn and sexual addiction is possible and wonderful!",Andrew Pipanne,"Health, Fitness & Dieting",098586690X
37,30 Perfect Popcorn Recipes : How to Make Sweet & Savory Gourmet Popcorn at Home (Volume 1),http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hDyzmR6eL.jpg,"Popcorn has probably been around longer than any other snack food on the planet. It has a rich history, dating back to before civilization and taking part in a multitude of events we celebrate every year. It’s the most popular snack food around the world, and the second most popular snack in America (falling just behind potato chips). Popcorn can be found all over the country, at movie theaters, carnivals, and most people’s kitchens or pantries. It is a common misconception that popcorn is an unhealthy snack. The reason some people avoid popcorn is because they don’t understand the real culprit! Behind its supposedly unhealthy status, are the seasonings and additives, often added to commercially packaged products to liven up the bland natural flavor and to lengthen it’s shelf life. The popcorn itself is a wholegrain, and these can help prevent cancer and lower the risk of heart disease, while also supplying healthy nutrients that support our vision. There are many different methods to create popcorn, but the basic principle stays the same. All you have to do is make the kernels hot enough to heat the moisture contained naturally inside, and turn that into steam. The steam creates pressure from inside the hard shell casing and before you know it, POP! - the kernel is turned inside out and is ready to be consumed. As long as you can generate heat and have some kernels on hand, you can make popcorn! Enough of the history, what about the recipes? I’ve gathered 30 of the finest popcorn recipes from around the world for your snacking pleasure, and have tried to keep them free from artificial sweeteners, preservatives or other nasty additives wherever possible. I’ve specified 9 cups of popped corn for most recipes, as that gives 3 generous cups per serving - you can have as many or as few servings as you fancy, but keep an eye on the calories! For your convenience, I’ve also included nutritional data from the USDA for each recipe - that’s the U.S. Department of Agriculture and not the United Square Dancers of America! My preference for both flavor and health reasons, is freshly air-popped popcorn - so I have used that kind for all of these recipes. Everything in this book can be made with kernels you have freshly popped, or if you are in a hurry (or feeling lazy!), then you can always use the plain store bought pre-popped variety - just make sure you check the packaging for artificial nasties! Most of the ingredients for these recipes can be found at your local grocery store or deli, but if you get stuck, then the slightly more unusual ones can also be bought online via this special page on my website - www.greengourmetbooks.com/ing Enjoy preparing and sharing!

39,Neurotox '91: Molecular Basis of Drug & Pesticide Action,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GtyzesRvL.jpg,"NEUROTOX '91 was the fourth meeting in a series which started in 1979. The '91 meeting, like its predecessors, was held under the patronage of the Society of Chemical Industry, and despite the unfortunate proximity of hostilities in the Arabian Gulf attracted a truly international mix of industrial and academic pesticide scientists. This volume contains the text of invited papers read at the meeting and presents the dramatic developments which so excited those who attended. The potential of molecular neurobiology for gaining knowledge of target sites for neurotoxicants is now starting to be realised. These studies, in conjunction with developments in molecular imaging and modelling, provide new oppor­ tunities for chemists and biologists to gain insights into molecular interactions underlying intoxication. Molecular techniques have also enabled rapid ad­ vances on a second front, where the cloning of genes controlling pesticide resistance should have a profound impact on our understanding of this commercially important problem. The understanding of molecular events will undoubtedly be vital in future developments in chemical control of pests; however, the value of understand­ ing the way in which the nervous system controls behaviour and how behaviour can be modified by chemicals of bath synthetic and natural origins was highlighted. Natural products and their synthetic analogues have continued to provide new and interesting molecules which are already proving their worth as tools for the neuroscientist and may offer leads for commercial synthesis.",,Medical Books,1851667466

46,Same-Sex Marriage and Religious Liberty: Emerging Conflicts,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518SWrMaF6L.jpg,"Same-Sex Marriage and Religious Liberty explores the religious freedom implications of defining marriage to include same-sex couples. It represents the only comprehensive, scholarly appraisal to date of the church-state conflicts virtually certain to arise from the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. It explores two principal questions. First, exactly what kind of religious freedom conflicts are likely to emerge if society embraces same-sex marriage? A redefinition of marriage would impact a host of laws where marital status affects legal rights_in housing, employment, health-care, education, public accommodations, and property, in addition to family law. These laws, in turn, regulate a host of religious institutions_schools, hospitals, and social service providers, to name a few_that often embrace a different definition of marriage. As a result, church-state conflicts will follow. This volume anticipates where and how these manifold disputes will arise. Second, how might these conflicts be resolved? If the disputes spark litigation under the Free Speech, Free Exercise, or Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment, who will prevail and why? When, if ever, should claims of religious liberty prevail over claims of sexual liberty? Drawing on experience in analogous areas of law, the volume explores whether it is possible to avoid these constitutional conflicts by statutory accommodation, or by separating religious marriage from civil marriage.",,Law,074256326X

In order to fully heal from trauma, a connection must be made with oneself, including one&rsquo;s body. The trauma-sensitive yoga described in this book moves beyond traditional talk therapies that focus on the mind, by bringing the body actively into the healing process. This allows trauma survivors to cultivate a more positive relationship to their body through gentle breath, mindfulness, and movement practices.<br> <i><br> Overcoming Trauma through Yoga </i>is a book for survivors, clinicians, and yoga instructors who are interested in mind/body healing. It introduces trauma-sensitive yoga, a modified approach to yoga developed in collaboration between yoga teachers and clinicians at the Trauma Center at Justice Resource Institute, led by yoga teacher David Emerson, along with medical doctor Bessel van der Kolk. The book begins with an in-depth description of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including a description of how trauma is held in the body and the need for body-based treatment. It offers a brief history of yoga, describes various styles of yoga commonly found in Western practice, and identifies four key themes of trauma-sensitive yoga. Chair-based exercises are described that can be incorporated into individual or group therapy, targeting specific treatment goals, and modifications are offered for mat-based yoga classes. Each exercise includes trauma-sensitive language to introduce the practice, as well as photographs to illustrate the poses. The practices have been offered to a wide range of individuals and groups, including men and women, teens, returning veterans, and others. Rounded out by valuable quotes and case stories, the book presents mindfulness, breathing, and yoga exercises that can be used by home practitioners, yoga teachers, and therapists as a way to cultivate awareness, tolerance, and an increased acceptance of the self.<br> &#160;</p>",David Emerson,Medical Books,1556439695

After Serbia outgunned the polyglot empire in a humiliating defeat, and the offensive into Russian Poland ended in the massacre of more than four hundred thousand Austro-Hungarians in just three weeks, the empire never recovered. While Austria-Hungary&rsquo;s ultimate defeat and dissolution were postponed until the autumn of 1918, the late summer of 1914 on the plains and hills of Galicia sealed its fate.</P>",John R.

79,Philosophy of Liberation:,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31u0ei%2BX%2BQL.jpg,"Argentinean philosopher, theologian, and historian Enrique Dussel understands the present international order as divided into the culture of the center -- by which he means the ruling elite of Europe, North America, and Russia -- and the peoples of the periphery -- by which he means the populations of Latin America, Africa, and part of Asia, and the oppressed classes (including women and children) throughout the world. In 'Philosophy of Liberation,' he presents a profound analysis of the alienation of peripheral peoples resulting from the imperialism of the center for more than five centuries. Dussel's aim is to demonstrate that the center's historic cultural, military, and economic domination of poor countries is 'philosophically' founded on North Atlantic onthology. By expressing supposedly universal knowledge, European philosophies, argues Dussel, have served to equate the cultural standards, modes of behavior, and rationalistic orientation of the West with human nature and to condemn the unique characteristics of peripheral peoples as nonbeing, nothing, chaos, irrationality. Hence, Western philosophies have historically legitimated and hidden the domination that oppressed cultures have suffered at the hands of the center. Dussel probes multinational corporations, the communications media, and the armies of the center with their counterparts among the Third World elite. The creation of a just world order in the future, according to Dussel, hinges on the liberation of the periphery, based on a philosophy that is able to think the world from the perspective of the poor and to reclaim the Third World's distinct cultural inheritance, which is imbedded in the popular cultures of the poor. Apart from the liberation of the periphery, there will be no future: the center will feed itself on the sameness it has ingrained within itself. The death of the child, of the poor, will be its own death. This is a disquieting but stimulating book for scholars and advanced students of philosophy, ethics, liberation theology, and global politics.",Enrique Dussel,Christian Books & Bibles,159244427X

Daughter, the main character and 25-year-old narrator whose mother died when she was very young, was raised by women in the community, some blood related, some not. When she was 12 years old she began her journey to womanhood guided by these very diverse, non-traditional, older black women. Daughter begins the play as an adult reflecting on the summer of her 12th year in the now empty house of her childhood. She shares with the audience how her Big Mamas prepared her for womanhood. As she remembers, the women enter to tell their stories and Daughter becomes a child again reliving her vivid memories of growing up--recalling the rituals, the faith healings, the stories she was told and the lessons she learned about survival, healing, deep faith and mystery. The Washington Post said Shakin' the Mess Outta Misery ""...is a vivid portrait of the members of a tight knit community of African American women...heartfelt and definitely a memory play, but it goes about its business in unpredictable and emotionally satisfying ways...First and foremost is Youngblood's evocative language, which blends the poetic and the everyday into a potent stew of exclamations and descriptions, oaths and jive...Some [scenes] are funny, some melancholy, some deadly serious, but all burst with detail, eccentricity and truth.""",Shay Youngblood,Literature & Fiction,1482639629

Telushkin has arranged the book in the traditional style of Jewish codes, with topical chapters and numbered paragraphs. Statements of law are almost invariably followed by anecdotes illustrating how these principles have been, or can be, practiced in daily life. The book can be read straight through to provide a solid grounding in Jewish values, consulted as a reference when facing ethical dilemmas, or studied in a group.<br><br>Vast in scope, this volume distills more than three thousand years of Jewish laws and suggestions on how to improve one&#8217;s character and become more honest, decent, and just.

But Nathan reveals the trio of women behind the legend: the willing patient, her ambitious shrink, and the imaginative journalist who spun their story into bestseller gold. <BR><BR><I>Sybil Exposed </I>draws from an enormous trail of papers, records, photos, and tapes to unearth the lives and passions of these three women whose story exploded into an epic movement with consequences beyond their wildest dreams. Set across the twentieth century and rooted in a time when few professional roles were available to women, this is a story of corrosive sexism, bold but unchecked ambition, runaway greed, utter human vulnerability, duplicity and shared delusion, shaky theories of psychoanalysis exuberantly and drastically practiced, and how one modest young woman&#8217;s life turned psychiatry on its head and radically changed the course of therapy&#8212;and our culture, as well.",Debbie Nathan,Medical Books,1439168288

141,"TRIPS, TRAVELS, and DREAMS: How LSD Saved Me",http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DHfSgiwNL.jpg,"<p>In 1966, a chance phone call from an old friend led Michael V. Palmer to San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, a place populated by hippies, musicians, psychics, and yogis. To Palmer’s delight, many of his new friends dabbled in all of the above, and everyone wanted to spread the love. Much of that good feeling stemmed from a collective mental awakening inspired by a new controversial psychedelic concoction: LSD.</p> <p>For Palmer and his contemporaries, LSD presented a unique opportunity to expand one’s mind. For the authorities, it heralded the collapse of social order.</p> <p>In the memoir <i>Trips, Travels, and Dreams: How LSD Saved Me</i>, Palmer’s unique personal story showcases the power of the psychedelically altered mind. Because of LSD use, he no longer lived within the confines of society’s expectations. Uniquely talented people, such as the psychic Vassily, encouraged him to follow his acid-induced dreams and visions down a life’s path that ultimately took him to more than sixty countries. </p> <p>This fascinating story, complete with an insightful analysis of the human psyche, proves a glowing testament to the power of the 1960s counterculture movement. </p>",Michael Vaughn Palmer,Biographies & Memoirs,1508530203

143,Walt Disney's Donald Duck: The Old Castle's Secret,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518gwTDkyML.jpg,"<div>With this volume, <i>The Complete Carl Barks Disney Library</i> loops back to Barks's earlier days, collecting the entirety of Bark's (astounding) 1948 output. The title story, <i>The Old Castle's Secret</i>, is notable not just for being the first full-length 32-page adventure instigated by Scrooge McDuck (in his second-ever appearance), but for featuring some of Bark's spookiest, lushest settings in old Clan McDuck castle of Dismal Downs. The other long story, <i>The Sheriff of Bullet Valley</i>, plunks Donald and the nephews in the Wild West, with Donald as an overconfident deputy having to deal with some high-tech rustlers. The book also includes the less-known <i>In Darkest Africa</i>, originally published in a giveaway and unreleased for decades. This volume also features an even 10 of Bark's dynamic <i>Walt Disney's Comics and Stories</i> 10-pagers, including <i>Wintertime Wager</i> (the first appearance of a not-yet-lucky-but-still-obnoxious Gladstone Gander); <i>Spoil the Rod</i> (in which the exquisitely named educational professor Pulpheart Clabberhead is brought in to help tame the nephews); <i>Rocket Race to the Moon </i>(a rare full-on adventure interplanetary, no less in the short form); <i>Gladstone Returns</i> and <i>Links Highjinks</i> (two more Gladstone yarns); and five more stories... plus a half-dozen hilarious one-page gags. Of course, once again all the stories have been shot from crisp originals, then re-colored (and printed) to match, for the first time since their original release over 60 years ago, the colorful yet soft hues of the originals and of course the book is rounded off with essays about Barks, the Ducks, and these specific stories by Barks experts from all over the world. <br>",Carl Barks,Comics & Graphic Novels,1606996533

147,The 2011 Import and Export Market for Blankets and Traveling Rugs in Lithuania,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-i-eLWJFL.jpg,"On the demand side, exporters and strategic planners focusing on blankets and traveling rugs in Lithuania face a number of questions. Which countries are supplying blankets and traveling rugs to Lithuania? How important is Lithuania compared to others in terms of the entire global and regional market? How much do the imports of blankets and traveling rugs vary from one country of origin to another in Lithuania? On the supply side, Lithuania also exports blankets and traveling rugs. Which countries receive the most exports from Lithuania? How are these exports concentrated across buyers? What is the value of these exports and which countries are the largest buyers? <br> <br>This report was created for strategic planners, international marketing executives and import/export managers who are concerned with the market for blankets and traveling rugs in Lithuania. With the globalization of this market, managers can no longer be contented with a local view. Nor can managers be contented with out-of-date statistics which appear several years after the fact. I have developed a methodology, based on macroeconomic and trade models, to estimate the market for blankets and traveling rugs for those countries serving Lithuania via exports, or supplying from Lithuania via imports. It does so for the current year based on a variety of key historical indicators and econometric models. <br> <br>In what follows, Chapter 2 begins by summarizing where Lithuania fits into the world market for imported and exported blankets and traveling rugs. The total level of imports and exports on a worldwide basis, and those for Lithuania in particular, is estimated using a model which aggregates across over 150 key country markets and projects these to the current year. From there, each country represents a percent of the world market. This market is served from a number of competitive countries of origin.

151,Lost Voices of Egypt: From Atakpa to Memphis,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XtMdcWzML.jpg,"<p>By offering some insights into a key area of West Africa, this book attempts to take the wonders of Ancient Egypt out of the realm of myths and folklore. The credit for the longevity of Ancient Egyptian traditions belongs to their erstwhile scribes,who managed to keep extensive records of Egypt’s history and achievements over an exceptionally long period. The Anang, Efik, and Ibibio people also deserve recognition for maintaining a spoken language that has notchanged very much from that spoken by the Ancient Egyptians at the various stages of their development, and for perpetuating a very unique culture that allows for the uncomplicated linkage of these two worlds. Bystudying this ancient language and culture, we can pose some formidable questions about our present—questions that shape our understanding ofthe genesis of the three main Middle Eastern religious movements, and that help explain the evolution of modern science.The fact that other venerated civilizations, including the Semites, Persians, and Greeks, represented “Egyptian” words inaccurately does not warrant perpetuating such corruption, as this would rob those words of their true essence. Much as the corrupted “English” words Ikobi, inokobi would not sound familiar to an English-speaker as the words “To be, or not to be,” neither do “words” like miri, kem, or osiris represent the Ancient Egyptian muara, ekim, and ase, respectively.......</p> <p>Page 56, “re men kimi” - In Efik, these corrupted words should read as uyo mön ekim, meaning “black voices” (voices of those who are black). Up until the earlier period of the present-day Copts, Egyptians referred to themselves as such: mön ekim. In a similar vein, the present-day speakers of this language—including the Efik, Ibibio, Anang, Örön, Etinan, Uyo, Nsit, Ibunö, Itu, Iköt Abasi, Öföt, Ediene, Eket, Abak, Iköt Aran, Iköt Ubö, Oku, Itam, Muaña (iba)—are described in similar fashion, i.e., “mön so-and-so.” In this case, mön is used in a generic manner as opposed to nuñ, which has particular relevance to family or ancestors.</p>",Mfon Eddie,Travel,1434352463
