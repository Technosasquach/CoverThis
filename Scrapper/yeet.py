The Beljanski method fights disease by targeting damaged or destabilized DNA in the body, allowing cells with healthy DNA to thrive. Beljanski, with his wife Monique, went on to develop natural compounds that enhance the body&#8217;s resistance not only to degenerative diseases but also to the effects of environmental toxicity and the ravages of aging. Beljanski&#8217;s compounds are now being studied at Columbia University, and other centers, where early findings support his theories.<br /><br />In this book, the authors build on Mirko Beljanski&#8217;s work to demonstrate how physiological and environmental factors both weaken the body&#8217;s immune system and alter DNA functioning. They explain how aging exacerbates these effects, leading to cancer and other diseases. The authors then present the innovative compounds Beljanski developed and how they are able to prevent dysfunctional cells from multiplying. They also detail how to integrate essential nutritional strategies for maximizing health and fighting aging at the cellular level."
